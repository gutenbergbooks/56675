<i>FOREWORD</i>
</p>

<p>
This story, which the authoress herself
entitled "The Attic Guest," would probably
have never been given to the world but for
an incidental visit which I paid to a certain manse.
It was then and there that the following chapters,
now first presented to the public, were entrusted to
my hands.  The hands which placed the manuscript
in my own were those of a lady of much charm,
modest, cultured, winsome; and no one could know
her without feeling that her qualities of heart were
even greater than of intellect.  She was a minister's
wife, as I need hardly say; and the busy years in that
most mellow of all vineyards had given her face
much of its own spiritual beauty, something of the
deep harvest-joy shining through her eyes.
Tranquil eyes were hers, chastened by many a sorrow,
yet aglow with a native merriment that the stern
schooling of a lifetime seemed powerless to subdue.
</p>

<p>
She asked that I would read her story; "and send
it forth," said she, "if your heart approve."
</p>

<p>
Her plea for asking this service at my hands was
that I had had some humble association with the
world of letters.  Mayhap she thought this pleased
me well&mdash;and perhaps it did.  I urged her to send
her book forth with her own name upon it&mdash;but this
she firmly refused.  She shrank from the publicity it
would involve, she said, as must any Southern lady.
I believed her implicitly.  "Especially," she went
on&mdash;dwelling earnestly on this&mdash;"since my book is
the frank and artless story of the most sacred things
of life, of a woman's life at that.  Some will smile,"
said she, "and some deride, and many disbelieve;
but the story is the story of my inmost work and
life and love.  Let it see the light if you think it
worthy."
</p>

<p>
I promised; and thus my promise is redeemed and
my humble part is done.

<i>THE ATTIC GUEST</i>
</h2>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
I
<br /><br />
<i>THE LIGHT FANTASTIC</i>
</h3>

<p>
"That room in the third story is good
enough for any elder," my mother was
saying as I came into the library; "more
than likely they'll send us a country elder anyhow,
and he'll never know the difference&mdash;he'll think it's
the spare room, I reckon."
</p>

<p>
I was only eighteen then, and I didn't care much
where elders slept, or whether they slept at all or
not.  Besides, it was already nine o'clock, and I was
going to a little party where "Tripping the light
fantastic" was to be the order of the evening.  By
the way, I only found out the other day that Milton
was the author of that fantastic toe phrase&mdash;and
the news startled me about as much as if some
one had told me Cromwell invented "Blind Man's
Buff."
</p>

<p>
"Has Dinah got me buttoned right?" I asked,
backing up to my Aunt Agnes.  Aunt Agnes was
my mother's sister.  I can see her yet, her hands
going up in an abstracted kind of way to correct one
of Dinah's oversights; for she was still revolving the
great question of the elder and the attic, the attic
and the elder.
</p>

<p>
"You're all right now, honey," she said in a moment,
giving me a gentle push away, her whole mind
reverting to the subject of family concern.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure," she went on in the same breath, "it's
going to be an elder from the country.  Mr. Furvell
told me to wait after prayer-meeting last night; and
he said the billeting committee sat till two in the
morning trying to divide the ministers and elders as
fairly as they could&mdash;and he thought we were going
to get an elder from Pollocksville."
</p>

<p>
"Let us hear what Henry thinks about it," my
mother suddenly interrupted, her face turned towards
the door as she spoke.  "Sit here, Henry," as she
made room on the sofa for my uncle; "sister Agnes
thinks it will be dreadful to send our delegate to the
attic if he's to be a minister&mdash;but she doesn't mind a
bit if he's an elder."
</p>

<p>
My uncle smiled as he took his place beside my
mother.  And the face that was turned in fondness
upon his wife at the other side of the room had a
look of kindly drollery.  For uncle was the tenderest
of men, and his countenance reflected the purity and
gentleness of his heart.  He was a gentleman of the
old school, was uncle.  His great-grandfather before
him had been born in our quaint little Virginian
town, and the gracious culture of a century and a
half had not been for nothing.  The mist of years
lies between me and that April evening when we
discussed the approaching Presbytery that was to
honour our little town by convening in our midst,
pondering our approaching guests as solemnly as
though they had been envoys from a royal court;
but I can still see the tall athletic form, not yet bowed
with age&mdash;he was less than fifty&mdash;and the careless-fitting,
becoming clothes that wrapped it in sober
black, and the easy dignity of his poise as he held
out his hands to the fire&mdash;above all, there rises clear
before me the grave and noble face, strength and
gentleness blending in the mobile mouth and aquiline
nose, while the large gray eyes looked out with the
loving simplicity of childhood upon the little circle that
was so dear to him and to which he was so dear.
Yet there was latent fire in those gentle eyes; when
in complete repose, they looked out like two
slumbering furnaces that needed only to be blown&mdash;and
any one familiar with the best type of Southern
gentlemen would have descried the old Virginian looking
through them, the native courage, the inborn anger
against meanness, the swift resentment of a wrong,
the reverence of womanhood, the pride of family,
that were such salient features of the old-time
patrician of the South.
</p>

<p>
"What's your say on the subject, Uncle Henry?"
my mother asked again, breaking the silence.  For
my uncle's gaze had wandered from his wife's face
and was now fixed upon the fire.  It was April, as I
have said, but a generous flame was leaping on the
hearth.  So generous, indeed, that the back window
whose tiny panes looked towards the west was open;
this is a form of conflicting luxuries which only
Southern folks indulge in.
</p>

<p>
"I just think the other way round," Uncle Henry
finally responded; "different from Agnes, I mean,"
his eyes smiling as they met his wife's.  "I'd send
him to the attic if he's a preacher; a minister wouldn't
be so apt to misunderstand, because they're trained
to sleep anywhere at a moment's notice&mdash;and they
know what it is to have to stow their own company
away in every nook and corner.  Besides, it's those
same preachers that make heaps o' folk sleep sitting
right bolt up in church.  But an elder," Uncle Henry
went on reflectively, "an elder kind o' wants to make
the most of it when he's visitin'&mdash;it's more of an
event to him, you see; they look on going to
Presbytery as a kind of rehearsal for going to heaven."
</p>

<p>
"Then they ought to be glad to get the highest
place," broke in my Aunt Agnes triumphantly, for
she had a ready wit.
</p>

<p>
"Depends on how you get there," retorted Uncle
Henry after a very brief but very busy pause; he had
no mind to be worsted in an argument if he could
help it.  "Everything depends on how it's given to
you.  There's all the difference in the world between
being lifted and being hoisted&mdash;I saw a fellow tossed
by a bull one day out at Cap'n Lyon's farm; he got
the highest place, all right, but he didn't seem to
relish the promotion."
</p>

<p>
My mother, who was accustomed to act as umpire
in these little contests, turned a humorous eye towards
Aunt Agnes.  The latter, we all knew, was fumbling
frantically for some response which seemed to elude
her; my mother's pose reminded me a little of the
man who had held the watch the week before, down
at Jacksonville, when two gentlemen of the ring had
paid their respects to each other.  I knew all about
how they're counted out if they don't show up within
a certain time; yet it isn't likely I'd have known
anything about it if Mr. Furvell hadn't warned us from
the pulpit that we mustn't read the account of the
affair&mdash;he said the details were shocking.  So I had
to wait till Aunt Agnes was finished with the paper.
</p>

<p>
I really do not know how the argument concluded,
for at this juncture a very sable face appeared
suddenly at the door and a liquid voice announced:
"Please, Miss Helen, Misteh Slocum's waitin' fo'
yeh in de parluh."
</p>

<p>
I was ready for the intimation, for I had heard the
old brass knocker muttering a minute or two before&mdash;and
I was just at the age when I knew the different
knocks of different gallants.  And not a few of these
latter were wont to lift that frowning brass face on
our front door and let it fall again&mdash;the wonderful
thing about it was, that the oftener they came the
more gentle grew the knock&mdash;but this is the way
with all knockers at all Southern homes that shelter
comely maidens.  And I am neither modest enough
nor untruthful enough to deny that I deserved the
adjective aforesaid&mdash;especially as this story may
never see the light till my eyes give it back no more.
</p>

<p>
"I'm hoping he'll be a minister," I volunteered, as
I turned a moment at the door.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" cried my mother.
</p>

<p>
"What for?" chimed my Aunt Agnes.
</p>

<p>
"Well," I answered, "elders pray too long&mdash;I
went to sleep one night at worship when that elder
from Hickory was here at the Synod.  And he said
I was a devout worshipper, don't you mind, when I
kept kneeling after you all got up.  I don't think
that was very nice for a religious man to say," I
averred, tugging at a reluctant glove.
</p>

<p>
"He wouldn't think so if he saw you now&mdash;starting
for a dance," suggested my Aunt Agnes.  "But
you look mighty sweet, honey&mdash;though I don't
believe you've got enough on for a chilly night like
this.  Be sure you have something round you when
you're coming home."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Slocum will see to that," assured Uncle
Henry, his expression interpreting his words.
</p>

<p>
"Hush," said my mother chidingly; "the child
doesn't know what you mean."  Every word of that
evening's conversation is vivid to me yet, as it well
might be; and I have often wondered why my
mother held such a sanguine view of my simplicity.
</p>

<p>
I don't remember much about the succeeding
frivolities of that April evening.  Sometimes I catch
again a few fugitive snatches of the melody that
inspired the mazy throng; I remember what I wore&mdash;it
served long years of umbrageous usefulness as a
lamp shade after I was through with it; and I think
I danced nearly every dance, no foreboding of
soberer days chastening the gladness.  And I forgot
all about the elder question, wondering no more
where he might lay his devoted head.  But before
Mr. Frank Slocum bade me good-night as I
disappeared within the heavy oaken door of my uncle's
house, he unwittingly recalled the subject.
</p>

<p>
"You're expecting a visitor to-morrow, aren't
you?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," I answered, suddenly remembering.
"Yes, we're going to have one of the men attending
the Presbytery; I think it's to be an elder&mdash;and I'm
afraid it's him for the attic," I concluded.  It was
half-past two and I was too tired to bother about
grammar.
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't thinking about the Presbytery," returned
Mr. Slocum, and he smiled in the moonlight.
"Somebody else is coming, isn't he?"
</p>

<p>
Whereat I hope I blushed; it was the time for that
mystic operation.  For I knew he referred to
Charlie, dear old Charlie, who made his pious
pilgrimage once a month&mdash;and I was the shrine.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he's coming," I said, toying with the
knocker as I spoke.
</p>

<p>
"You don't seem as jubilant about it as you ought
to be," ventured Mr. Frank.
</p>

<p>
"You don't know how I feel," said I; "maybe I'm
jubilant inside."
</p>

<p>
"Then you shouldn't sigh," pursued my escort.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know I sighed&mdash;but, even if I did,
perhaps sighs are like dreams, and go by contraries,"
I returned, making the best stand I could.  "A
maiden's heart is an unknown sea," I affirmed,
quoting from some distant poem.
</p>

<p>
"Besides," Frank went on, disdainful of all poetry,
"if you really cared like you ought to, you wouldn't
be out so late the night before; you'd be having your
beauty sleep right now, just to be lovely when he
came&mdash;or, at least, to be even lovelier," he amended;
for Frank was a Southern gentleman.
</p>

<p>
"I never had it bad enough to go to bed over it,"
I admitted; "but he'll be here to-morrow&mdash;he'll be
here to-morrow," I chanted, as ecstatically as I could.
Yet I felt at the time that the words didn't ring
much; it was a little like trying to peal a chime on
a row of pillows.  Then, before I knew it, I yawned,
yawned brazenly into the face of the brass knocker
on the door.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly!" said Frank, his hand moving to his
hat, "that's just about the size of it&mdash;Miss Helen,
you're a little idiot," and his honest eyes shone
bright with their candour of affection.
</p>

<p>
"Sir!" said I, employing a splendid intonation.
And I gave a little stamp on the stone step beneath
me&mdash;all true Southern girls love to stamp.  "Sir!"
I repeated, "you forget yourself."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't forget <i>you</i>," Frank retorted swiftly,
his face quivering a little; "though I wish I could, a
little more.  And I know you don't care anything
about him, the way he thinks you do&mdash;or the way he
wants you to.  And God help him&mdash;and you
too&mdash;if something doesn't happen; you have either gone
too far, or not far enough, Miss Helen," he declared
boldly, looking straight into my eyes in the moonlight.
And I couldn't help gazing back, for his look
and his words both had a kind of fascination for me;
I reckon I knew they both were true.  So I didn't
get angry&mdash;only a lot of things, all connected with
the past, rushed like a flood before me.  But I will
tell them all in another chapter.  I had no mind to
discuss them with Frank just then.
</p>

<p>
So I simply said "Good-night, I'm going in."  And
Frank said good-night with great respect and
turned to go away.  I peeped through the crack just
before I closed the door, and I could see that his eyes
were on the pavement and his step was slow.  Yet I
cared nothing for that, except as it boded what might
be of interest to myself.

<h3>
II
<br /><br />
<i>JUST EIGHTEEN</i>
</h3>

<p>
As I sit and look back on it all now, I feel
almost sure that a girl's real life begins at
somewhere about eighteen years of age.  A
boy is different; his life begins at a great many
different times.  To start with, he has a distinct
promotion at four or five&mdash;he casts off skirts forever, with
contempt, and that itself is a promotion.  Then he
takes on the uniform of manhood, glorying in the
frank two-leggedness of his kind; and in quite a real
sense this marks the beginning of his manhood.
Indeed, a boy has mile-posts all along the way.  Top
boots come next, and the first pair, clothing his knees
with their red leather crown, give life a rosy
splendour.  This pales, of course, as does all other
glory&mdash;but the day reappears in divers forms.  His curls are
one day amputated, falling fast, the hour of their
doom still bright with an undaunted sheen&mdash;and the
young Samson shakes himself gleefully in this new
token of manly strength.  Then comes his first game
of ball, or his first venture with tools; or he is one
day permitted to hold a slumbering butcher-horse
while its master steps within; in return, he is allowed
to drive a block or two&mdash;trifling enough, as some one
smiles and says, but every boy remembers it and it
marks a new stage of power.  About this time he
learns to swim; all the past is forgotten, the future
all despised, till he becomes amphibious.  Then
comes his first watch&mdash;time is annihilated in the
tumult of that hour; then a gun of his own&mdash;its first
report is heard around the world.  And so it goes
on, ever onward, from one lock to another in life's
long waterway.  By and by the stream widens far;
he must choose his profession&mdash;then his partner&mdash;then
someone, and the romance seems never at an end.
</p>

<p>
But a girl's life has no such variety; skirts are her
abiding portion, from swaddling clothes to shroud.
And her curls, undisturbed, thicken with the years.
No top boots for her, nor game of ball, nor wizardry
of tools; for her nothing but the long drab way of
girlhood, beginning with the nursery and ending with
the same.
</p>

<p>
Till she is about eighteen.  Then comes, or almost
always comes, the first waterfall in the stream of time.
And what a wild cataract it is, leaping with the tidal
movement of her soul!  And how mystically deep
that spring of love which is its far-off source!  And
how the light of heaven plays upon it all!
</p>

<p>
I was just eighteen when this first came to me.
And all my eighteen years before seem now, as I
recall them, like a placid afternoon such as slips by
unnoticed in the summer-time; the clock strikes the
hour, I suppose, but no one hears it.
</p>

<p>
I was born in 187-.  No woman is ever quite
content to tell the very year, but the decade does not
matter.  And my mother has often told me what a
lovely October day it was&mdash;my dawn was mingled
with the deepening twilight, and the flowers were still
abloom in the garden, and some darky children were
playing in the dusty road before the door, and the
soft autumn sky was now wreathed in smiles, now
bathed in tears, fitting symbol of the checkered life
that lay before me.
</p>

<p>
My father died when I was two and a half.  My
only recollection of him is an impression of his great
height and strength as he once bore me on his
shoulder, when I had toddled a few yards from the
door to meet him.  My mother tells me I often
started forth on very uncertain feet, as often borne
back with my arms about his neck&mdash;but there lingers
with me the memory of only one such pilgrimage.
Yet it is distinct and vivid, I am thankful to say,
and I can see yet the low brick fence, with its cope
of stone, all vine-entangled as it was; and to this day
I never catch the breath of the magnolia without
seeing again the full-bloomed beauty that stood close to
the steps within the wall.  I think I plucked a spray
as I was borne past it that evening on my father's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Both my mother and my aunt thought it strange
that I have no recollection of my father as he lay in
the calm majesty of death; for my mother took me
with her alone into the parlour and shut the door
upon us three when she took her last farewell&mdash;so she
has often told me, her voice breaking as she spoke.
And she says I wanted to linger after she turned to
go, gazing steadfastly upon the silent face, fascinated
by the master mystery of life; it seems, too, that even
in her grief she noticed my disdain of the lovely
flowers that ensconced the coffin, though I had the
child's passion for those gratuities of God, so
all-absorbing was the witchery of death.  And I have
been told, though none of my kinsfolk ever mentioned
it&mdash;the old undertaker told me himself one day when
I was playing among the shavings in his shop&mdash;how
pitifully hard I fought when they began to shovel in
the clay after my father had been lowered to his
grave.  It is one of our Southern customs for the
ladies, veiled past recognition, to follow their dead to
the uttermost; and it was in the cemetery I dropped
my mother's hand and began my unavailing struggle
to rescue my father from suffocation and eternal
night.  I was borne away, probably easily beguiled,
and my father was left to his long loneliness.  But I
remember nothing of either of these incidents, great
and tragical as I thought them, and still think them
to be; even yet, I never turn away from a new-filled
grave without a sense of selfish cruelty&mdash;there seem
such oceans of God's fresh air everywhere, yet denied
to those we leave behind.  And I have never been
able to free myself from the pain of this bitter
helplessness&mdash;that there comes a time when the best we
can do for our nearest and dearest is to leave them all
alone beneath the darkening sky.
</p>

<p>
Those who knew her best say that my mother was
never the same again.  No melancholy, or despondency,
or indifference to life came to mark the change,
but her soul took new depth under the influence of
sorrow and her outlook was more to the eternal.
There was plenty of brightness and merriment&mdash;frank
laughter, too&mdash;all of her after life; but it was the play
of the sunlight upon the noble gloom of ocean, stirred
gently by some influence from afar.
</p>

<p>
She soon abandoned her own home, leaving it to
strangers; they saw no white face on the pillow in
the front room up-stairs&mdash;they gave dances in the
parlour, and no recumbent form disturbed the revelry.
My mother's sister was Mrs. Lundy, my Aunt Agnes;
her husband was Henry Lundy, my Uncle Henry.
To their home we went to live, I in unconscious glee,
my mother in hope of healing.  There my life was
spent till I was eighteen years of age&mdash;and later; but
my story begins with that particular year, which, as
I have hinted, is to so many a maiden's life like the
month of April to the Northern river&mdash;for then the
ice breaks up and the stream moves outward to the
sea.
</p>

<p>
I was eighteen when I fell in love.  That is, if I
fell at all&mdash;concerning which I have my doubts.  For
many a girl thinks she has <i>fallen</i> in love when all the
time she <i>walked</i> in.
</p>

<p>
Ah me! those days are far past now; but the
words I have just written gave my pen a good half
hour's rest while I mused on all the meaning of them.
For after a girl becomes a mother, after she has
children of her own&mdash;which is about the same thing&mdash;she
is far more fastidious about love, and far more
solicitous that it should be genuine, than when she
was choosing for herself.  And she knows then, what
she knew not at eighteen, that the difference between
falling in love and walking into it, is just the
difference between Heaven and&mdash;Hades.  (What a
convenient word "Hades" is!  It was made, I reckon,
expressly for woman's use.)
</p>

<p>
Well, I am afraid I <i>walked</i> in, the first time I got
in love.  Yet I feel it is a sort of blasphemy to say
the <i>first</i> time&mdash;for no true girl is ever really in love
but once; born, loved, died, thus stand the mountain
peaks of life, and each can rise but once.  So I must
amend by saying that the first time I tried to be in
love, and everybody else thought I really was, I got
there by the pedestrian route.  I rather think I
honestly wanted to be in love, had almost resolved to be;
and when a girl's face is once set in that direction
she will see land ahead, though half an ocean lie
between&mdash;or, to change the figure, she is like those
silly chanticleers that crow at midnight, thinking it
the dawn.
</p>

<p>
One other thing, too, I must tell in my defense.
I was <i>pushed</i> in.  A dearer and more devoted mother
than mine no girl ever had.  But this I will dare to
say&mdash;and I am old enough to know&mdash;I do believe
every true mother-heart has, somewhere in its great
expanse, a cavity that aches, never to be filled till
some one who loves her daughter comes to dwell
there evermore, bone of her bone and flesh of her
flesh by the great adoption of their united love.
Two streams, both different&mdash;but the confluence is
mighty.  And then there is another cavity, farther
in, its ache more poignant still&mdash;and that place is
never filled, that pain never banished, till she scans
some baby face, her leaping heart descrying the likeness
to her own, all the lovelier because the image of
the adopted mingles with it.
</p>

<p>
I am right well aware how horrified my mother
would have been if any one had dared to hint that
she, or any other gentlewoman, cherished the hope
of some day being either mother-in-law or
grandmother&mdash;or both; and I cannot help a little shudder
as I write those terms myself.  But the truth as I
first set it down, free from those rude bald words, is
not to be denied.
</p>

<p>
It was at the seaside that I first met Charlie
Giddens.  Mother and I met him the same evening, in
the midst of a merry dance on the grand piazza.  He
was tall and dark, and his hair was gloriously
rebellious, every way for Sunday.  We both noticed
that he looked at us a little long, a little earnestly, I
thought&mdash;but he asked mother to dance first, and
that's where his head was level.
</p>

<p>
"Don't fill your program all up, Helen," she
whispered as she handed me her fan, gliding out with
the tall figure, so handsome in his spotless ducks.
</p>

<p>
"Did you notice how gracefully he handed me to
my seat?" mother said after he had left her; "he has
the manners of a cavalier."  For the old-time
Southern lady puts gracefulness next to grace.
</p>

<p>
"He dances like a Dervish of the Desert," I
remarked, a little maliciously perhaps&mdash;for he had
bowed and left us.
</p>

<p>
"Like a courtier, you mean," my mother
amended, her eyes still following him.  "And his
father's a ship owner in Savannah, and his mother
comes from one of the oldest families in South
Carolina," concluded my mother, naming the ancient
house.
</p>

<p>
"That's why you like his dancing," I suggested;
"old families all dance exquisitely&mdash;the older, the
sprightlier, it seems."
</p>

<p>
"He has such a delicate way of putting things,"
pursued my mother; "he was describing his mother
to me, and he said she had a lovely figure, just about
my size," surveying somewhat hopefully her rather
substantial form the while.  For this was a very live
issue with my mother; she lived in daily horror of
growing stout, and any such reassuring word was
balm of Gilead to her.
</p>

<p>
But what's the use of going on with this?  This
story's main concern is not with my dancing days,
and what I have written, or yet shall write,
regarding them, is only a streamlet leading towards the
river of my life.  And my story&mdash;if it be ever
finished, or however far it roam, must follow the
winding current of my changeful years.
</p>

<p>
Yet this I must record, that Mr. Giddens came
back that night and stood once again beneath the
swinging lanterns that cast their fitful light on
mother's face and mine.  And he asked for another
dance&mdash;but it was not from mother.  And whenever
we swirled before her as we compassed the great
piazza, I could see how mother's eyes followed us
approvingly, more approving than I had ever known
them to be before.
</p>

<p>
And thus it all began&mdash;all that never should have
been begun at all.  That is what I meant when I
said, a little farther back, that I was <i>pushed</i> into
love&mdash;and by my own dear mother.  Oh, it all seems so
terrible, so cruel to me now, looking back over all
the happy years, beautiful in the uncreated light of
love&mdash;it is really awful to reflect how often the hands
that love her most are the fateful hands to many a
girlish life, pushing the poor protesting heart, so
gently, yet so relentlessly, pressing it on, on to the
dark abyss of a loveless union.  Mr. Giddens was of
gentle birth, I know; he was handsome, cultured,
charming,&mdash;and he was very rich.  All these shed
their light about him, and my mother gloried in their
radiance.  Their light, I said&mdash;but it was artificial.
The summer sun of love had never shined on me at
all; so that while I could not but feel the effulgence
of it all, yet only one room of my life was lighted,
and that the hallway&mdash;the vast world within was still
wrapt in darkness.  I knew all the time that I did
not really love Mr. Giddens.  Yet I could not see
why I should not&mdash;and there the great peril lay.  It
was that fatal path that misled me.  All the outward
sign-posts pointed my way as leading towards his
own&mdash;but these sign-posts were marked by human
hands alone, and my mother never tired of spelling
out their message.
</p>

<p>
"There's not a girl in Virginia," she said one day,
"but would give her head for him.  He's aristocratic,
and handsome, and rich."
</p>

<p>
"And the greatest of these is rich," quoth I.
</p>

<p>
"For shame!" cried my patrician mother, "that's
the least of it."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," I retorted.  "For if a girl doesn't
love a man as fiercely as&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"As what!" exclaimed my mother, shocked.
</p>

<p>
"As devotedly as she should," I revised, "she
won't get much comfort out of his blue blood&mdash;and
she can't do much with his beauty&mdash;but his cash is a
different matter," I affirmed; "she could get her little
hands on that all right."
</p>

<p>
"Helen, you're a foolish child," said my mother
gravely.
</p>

<p>
"That's what I often think myself," said I, more
gravely still.
</p>

<p>
Well, that was the way it went on.  I told him
"yes" one night.  I do not believe he heard me,
but he seemed to know I yielded, for he did what he
had never done before&mdash;nor ever other man beside.
And thus life's greatest, holiest moment was stained
to me; and the sacred altar was lighted with far
different fire than that for which God meant it.  I had
never been kissed before&mdash;at least not that way&mdash;and
even then I felt how I was cheated of my birthright,
and I marvelled at the sense of shame.  But that can
never be recalled, so I try not to dwell upon it.  Nor
can it be amended, and the loss is to eternity.  I
have known the rapture since then, the primal
bliss&mdash;but the virgin joy was tempered with the cruel
thought that it had all been rehearsed before.  And
the bitterest feature of it all is this, that it had never
been, except for her who loved me with a mother's
love.  But her ambition mingled with her love&mdash;and
these two are enemies.
</p>

<p>
If I had been a little more in love, I reckon mother
would not have tried so hard to urge me on.  But I
was not&mdash;I was a little less.  And mother kept
kneeling beside the poor little flame on the mean altar of
my heart, to quote the old hymn, and she kept the
bellows going pretty steadily, if haply she might
make the fire burn.  Or if I had been a little less in
love, perhaps she would have given over&mdash;for I was
dear to her.  But I was not; I admitted he was rich,
and handsome, and superior&mdash;and these seemed quite
enough reason to a girl's mother why there should
be true affection.  So I was neither a little more, nor
yet a little less, in love with Charlie&mdash;and that is
Hades, to use the convenient word again, when it
has to do duty for the real thing.  But mother kept
on encouraging me, saying she knew I'd be very
happy, and drawing lovely pictures of the position
I would occupy and the leadership in society that
would be mine; and mothers can make ashes look
like bread&mdash;only they don't have to eat them through
the hungry years.

<br /><br />
<i>THE BRIDGE THAT LAY BETWEEN</i>
</h3>

<p>
"Do you think we're a star chamber?" I said
to my mother, as she stood at the parlour
door with a cushion under either arm.
</p>

<p>
"Think you're what?  Think who's what?" she
queried in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"Where are you taking those cushions to?" I
pursued, glancing at her burden.
</p>

<p>
"To the up-stairs sitting-room.  You know uncle
always takes a nap before he goes to bed."  Which
was true enough; uncle fancied he didn't sleep well
if he neglected this preliminary canter on the sofa.
That was where he was wont to try divers notes till
he struck the proper key for the night's performance.
</p>

<p>
"That's where you all are going to stay this evening,"
I averred.  "Uncle will snooze there while you
and aunty play cribbage."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course&mdash;why?" answered my mother
wonderingly.  "You and Mr. Giddens will be in the
parlour, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
"That's what I meant about the star chamber," I
rejoined.  "I think it's right foolish, the way you all
take to your heels when Charlie spends an evening
here.  There's a plenty of room in the parlour for us
all."
</p>

<p>
"There shouldn't be," my mother made reply; "I
never saw the room big enough for more than two
when your father and I were lovers&mdash;which we were
the longest day he lived," she added, her voice
softening to the romantic note.
</p>

<p>
"And did you always want to be alone?" I asked
seriously; "always alone together&mdash;before you were
married, I mean?"
</p>

<p>
My mother smiled, her eyes half closing in reminiscent
thought.  "Yes, child," she answered slowly,
"alone&mdash;together; I believe those two words
describe nearly all the joy of life&mdash;alone&mdash;together.
Don't you know what I mean, Helen?" and there
was a deep tenderness in her voice as she dropped
one of the cushions on a chair, coming close and
taking me in her arms; "doesn't my dear one know
the meaning of it?  Oh, Helen, I want you to be so
happy.  And you will be, won't you&mdash;you are, aren't
you, my darling?  You love him, don't you, Helen?"
</p>

<p>
My face was hidden in her bosom.  After a minute's
silence she drew back, that she might look into
my eyes.  "You love him, don't you, dear?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said, again seeking the shelter of her
breast.
</p>

<p>
"I'm so glad, my darling," she murmured.  Then
she picked up the fallen cushion and went on her
way up-stairs.
</p>

<p>
I stood by the piano, listlessly fingering some
music sheets that lay on top of it.  Suddenly the
stillness was broken by my mother's voice.
</p>

<p>
"Helen," she cried; "oh, Helen."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dear," I answered, stepping to the door.
</p>

<p>
"I forgot to tell you the news; our Presbytery
guest isn't coming till to-morrow.  They sent us
word just this afternoon&mdash;and they're almost sure it's
going to be an elder."
</p>

<p>
"Then 'it' will have to go in the attic," I rejoined,
shouting the opprobrious pronoun up the stairs.
</p>

<p>
"Helen, dear," the tender voice remonstrated,
"how can you speak like that&mdash;calling him
'it.'  That isn't respectful, child."
</p>

<p>
"It's your word," responded I; "you said it's
going to be an elder."
</p>

<p>
"But I didn't actually call him it," my mother
defended.  Her answer was rather long in coming;
I could tell she was struggling with the verbal
problem.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, I beg his pardon," I conceded;
"anyhow he won't care what we called him, when he
strikes the attic," and the argument ended in a duet
of laughter.
</p>

<p>
"And, Helen," resumed my mother, by this time
one or two steps down-stairs, "don't you think you'd
better dress?  Mr. Giddens ought to be here right
soon now, shouldn't he?  I think you ought to wear
your pink organdy&mdash;he says he loves you in pink,
you know."
</p>

<p>
"He ought to love me in buckskin," I flung back,
"if he loves me at all.  He ought to love me for my
own sweet self undecorated&mdash;you see, mother, how
romantic you're making me.  If he's really got the
frenzy he won't need any pink things to infuriate
him," I insisted, laying Spanish bull-fights under
tribute.
</p>

<p>
"Please yourself, child," my mother responded as
she disappeared, "but I know, when your father was
courting me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You ought to write a book on the subject,
mother," I interrupted gaily; "you've evidently had
it down to a science.  If you'd write a book and call
it 'First Principles of Courtship' or 'Love-making for
Beginners' you'd help things on a lot."  But by this
time mother was beyond the range of conversation
and my literary counsel met with no response.
</p>

<p>
I went back to the parlour.  The music sheets were
fumbled once again.  Then I tried to read, but found
it impossible to settle down.  I turned once more to
the piano and presently found myself softly singing
a little love-verse, familiar since my childhood.  I
crooned it once or twice:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Still must you call me tender names<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still gently stroke my tresses;<br />
  Still shall my happy answering heart<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep time to your caresses.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The words made me lonely&mdash;like a phantom song.
I involuntarily smiled a little as I caught myself
sighing while the piano notes died away; perhaps it was
the gathering twilight that gave me such a plaintive
feeling in the region of my heart.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a voice came from above.  It was Aunt
Agnes this time.
</p>

<p>
"Hear that, Helen?" she sang out.  "There's
music in that screech, isn't there?"
</p>

<p>
"What screech?" I answered back, a little suspicious
that she referred to my simple warblings.  Yet
I knew she could scarcely have heard.
</p>

<p>
"The locomotive," she promptly replied.  "Didn't
you hear that engine whistle?&mdash;that's his train, you
know.  I reckon you were listening for it all right."
</p>

<p>
I rose and moved to the window, grimly wondering
if ever lover had so many assistants in the business.
I could see the white puffs of smoke as the
train steamed slowly into the distant station.  The
dreamy ringing of the bell floated in through the
open window, mingling with the pensive sounds of
evening.
</p>

<p>
And I was lonely, so lonely!  I knew that Charlie
had just alighted from the train, doubtless hurrying
even now to his hotel.  He would soon shake its dust
from off his feet, I knew, and old "Rastus"&mdash;Rastus
knew Charlie's orbit and kept a keen lookout
for him&mdash;would bring him with fitting haste to me.
My cheek reddened, then paled, as I seemed to see
Charlie's eager face, his impatient arms, his ardent
lips.  I quivered a little, and tore two or three of the
petals from a rose I had chosen from a bowlful on
the table; the harmless things floated to the
pavement beneath the window.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a bird's rich full note fluttered in and fell
upon my ear.  I listened.  And his mate responded&mdash;full
and sweet and tremulous the answer came.
The love-throb pulsed vibrant through it.  I thought
it beautiful; and I listened, enchanted, as the tender
message came again and again.  Soon the note grew
fainter&mdash;and I think I caught a glimpse of the winged
lovers as they glided close together into their bridal
chamber in the deep shade of the magnolia tree.
The rich blossoms hung like curtains, quivering a
little where the mated pair had passed within&mdash;that
fragrant retreat was holy.
</p>

<p>
Still gazing, my attention was diverted by the
sound of feet upon the brick pavement that went past
our house.  I listened, watching.  And a minute or
two later, all unconscious of my presence, a youth
and maiden passed beneath the window.  Neither
was speaking, and their steps were slow, as if they
cared not where they led.  Somehow they
compelled my interest at once.  I knew them both,
though their station was quite different from mine.
She collected belated accounts for a local laundry&mdash;he
drove their horse, delivering from door to door.
I watched them wistfully as they passed on, by and
by leaning out the window to follow their career.
They turned to the left and made their way out on to
the bridge.  And I saw him once&mdash;though the dusk
was deepening&mdash;I saw him take her hand; she
withdrew it quickly, but he gently recovered it a
moment later, this time without resistance.  And thus
they went on together, far out on the lonely
bridge, every step taking them farther from
everybody else, but nearer to each other.  The twilight
hid them soon; and they were alone together in the
shelter of the gathering dark.
</p>

<p>
Then was a wild tumult surging in my heart.  I
wondered what made it, and why the lump rose so
persistently in my throat, even while I feared to
know.  For she was only a working girl, I thought,
and he a swain who drove a beast of burden.  Yet I
knew that that old bridge, rickety and worn, lay
between me and the Celestial.  And I wondered who it
was that wrote that song about the tender names and
the tresses so gently to be stroked.
</p>

<p>
I went back towards the piano; for I heard the distant
sound of wheels.  Then I rang the bell; a servant
appeared in an instant.
</p>

<p>
"Lyddie," I said, "light the gas, please."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Miss Helen.  I done seen a transfeh drivin'
to the fwont doah, Miss Helen," as she returned with
the taper.
</p>

<p>
"I heard it too," said I.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
IV
<br /><br />
<i>THE DANGER ZONE</i>
</h3>

<p>
The stealthy dawn was just laying its gray
hand on the slowly waking world as I crept
the next morning into my mother's room.
I was shivering a little, for our April mornings are
often far from warm.  Besides, I was excited&mdash;and
the night had been passed in sleeplessness.
</p>

<p>
"Is that you, child?" my mother asked, starting
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, are you asleep?"
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?  Are you sick?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I answered, creeping in; "but I want to talk
to you.  I'm frightened."
</p>

<p>
"What frightened you?" and my mother's tone
was louder&mdash;"anybody trying to break in?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, nothing like that," as I cuddled closer.
"But I want to talk to you&mdash;Mr. Giddens frightened
me."
</p>

<p>
My mother was all awake.  "Mr. Giddens, child,"
she exclaimed, rising a little on the bed; "how on
earth could he frighten you?  Tell me how," the
note in her voice more imperative now.
</p>

<p>
I was silent a moment, not knowing just how to
begin.  Perhaps I felt a little ridiculous too.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, Helen," my mother said presently, and
quite firmly; "I'm waiting."
</p>

<p>
"Well," I began hesitatingly; "well, it's
this&mdash;he wants me to get married."
</p>

<p>
My mother made an impatient poke at the bed-clothes.
Then she partly rose on her elbow.  Then
she turned her pillow, finally laying her head back
upon it.
</p>

<p>
"Helen Randall," she broke out, and her voice,
like the dawn, had a gray tinge about it, "Helen
Randall, you're a silly little goose&mdash;coming in here
trembling, and waking me up and scaring me half
to death, only to tell me that the man you're
engaged to wants to marry you."
</p>

<p>
"But, mother," I began earnestly, "it's
different&mdash;you don't understand."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, child," she interrupted, "there isn't
anything to understand.  What do folks get
engaged for?  What does any lover want, except to
get married?  And this is the great fright you
got; it seems that you got engaged to a man, and
then he alarms you by suggesting you get married!
Let's go to sleep," and my mother patted the pillow
with her cheek, preparing to resume the operation I
had interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"But I won't go to sleep," persisted I.  "You
don't understand&mdash;Mr. Giddens wants to marry me
right off&mdash;right away soon."  My mother turned
her head a little on the pillow.  She was wakening
fast.
</p>

<p>
"What's that you say?" she said.
</p>

<p>
I knew she had heard me quite well, but I
repeated it willingly enough.  "I say he wants to
get married&mdash;very soon.  His family is going to
Europe shortly&mdash;and it seems his father says we can
spend the first part of our honeymoon on the
<i>Sea-Nymph</i>, and then join them all in Europe later
on.  And so Charlie has quite made up his mind
that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What's the <i>Sea-Nymph</i>?" interrupted my
mother eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"It's the name of the yacht&mdash;a new yacht they've
got."
</p>

<p>
"A yacht?  A private yacht?" breathlessly
asked my mother.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, a private yacht," I answered, not much
elated about it either.
</p>

<p>
"I knew a family in Norfolk once that had a
private yacht," my mother reflected, just a little
reverently.  "And all those rich New York people
keep yachts at Newport," she added in a kindred
tone.
</p>

<p>
"That doesn't matter much," I said, a trifle
acridly; "half of the people on them seem to be
divorced, if you can believe the papers.  But
Charlie's quite set on this plan of his&mdash;of theirs&mdash;and
I'm distressed to death about it.  I don't want to
just go right away so soon," and my voice shook
in spite of myself as I nestled a little closer to my
mother.
</p>

<p>
"What did you tell him, Helen?" she asked in a
whisper.
</p>

<p>
"I said no&mdash;at first."
</p>

<p>
"And what after?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing&mdash;that's the worst of it."
</p>

<p>
"Why?  Why the worst of it?" pursued my
mother.
</p>

<p>
"Because he thinks I will&mdash;and it frightens me."
</p>

<p>
"Helen," and mother's voice was quite reproachful,
"I can't make you out at all, child.  You've
promised to marry him&mdash;and I can't understand
you.  Why, when your father wanted me to marry
him I couldn't get too early a day&mdash;and we didn't
have any yacht either."
</p>

<p>
"No, but you had father," I interposed.
</p>

<p>
"That's foolish," said my mother.  And I
thought it was myself, although I felt my rejoinder
had a meaning I couldn't just explain.
</p>

<p>
We talked till the sun was pouring in through the
eastern window; yet we determined little else than
this&mdash;that mother thought I should and I was almost
sure I couldn't.
</p>

<p>
I think we all felt better in the morning.  Mother
and I certainly did; even Europe and a yacht didn't
impress me so formidably as in the ghostly dawn.
We had shad for breakfast, fresh from its briny
home; and if shad be skillfully cooked it can colour
all the succeeding day.  Wherefore, when we were
all gathered on the porch in the glorious sunshine
mother immediately became communicative.  She
had previously advised me that it would be better to
say nothing to Uncle Henry or Aunt Agnes about
the subject that engrossed us both; this of itself was
almost a guarantee to me that mother would tell it
all, for she generally took this means of reserving
that luxury to herself.  So it wasn't very long till
she had told them all about it.  Before she was
through, the private yacht had grown to dimensions
of a man-of-war fitted up in oriental splendour&mdash;and
I had been all but presented to half the crowned
heads in Europe.
</p>

<p>
"And I've been telling Helen how foolish she is,"
she concluded earnestly, looking to my aunt and
uncle for confirmation of her view.  "It isn't every
girl gets a chance of a honeymoon on a yacht, is it,
Henry?" nodding towards me over her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
But uncle didn't seem as agitated as he should
have been.  "Oh, I don't know," he replied drawlingly,
"it depends on your position on the yacht.  I
suppose there'll be women aboard, cooks and such
like, that nobody'd envy very much."
</p>

<p>
"Position!" my mother ejaculated vigorously; "I
should think the wife of the owner would have
position enough for anybody."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;if she owns <i>him</i>," replied my uncle slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Owns what?" echoed my mother.  "What do
you mean, Henry?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean if she owns <i>him</i>," repeated uncle cheerfully;
"if she loves him enough, you know&mdash;and if
he does the same.  Sooner be on an old raft&mdash;if they
really own each other," uncle went on quite seriously,
"than the finest ship in the world&mdash;if they don't."
</p>

<p>
"You're great on love," said mother; "and that's
all right for a beginning&mdash;but there are other things
besides.  I think love needs a good solid foundation
to build on," as she nodded emphatically towards
my uncle.
</p>

<p>
"Yachts aren't very solid things," retorted the
latter calmly; "and Europe's a long piece away.  And
if my views on love aren't what they ought to be,
blame Agnes there," as he looked in unevasive
tenderness towards his wife.
</p>

<p>
I caught the look she cast back at him; it made
me think of the lonely bridge.  I glanced, too, at
the bloom-laden magnolia&mdash;and the thought flashed
through my mind that an old raft, as uncle said,
might be made heavenly enough.
</p>

<p>
"When is Mr. Giddens going to call again?" my
mother suddenly enquired.  "I heard him say he
was going home on Monday."
</p>

<p>
"He's coming now," Aunt Agnes announced in a
low voice; "yonder, look&mdash;he's just coming past the
Hickey's boat-house," her keen eye studying the
distant figure.  "And who's that with him?" she
exclaimed a moment later; "why, it's Mr. Furvell,
sure as the world.  I reckon he's coming here
too&mdash;some news about the elder, likely enough.  I didn't
know he and Mr. Giddens were acquainted."
</p>

<p>
"Neither they are," said my mother.  "I reckon
they just happened in with each other."
</p>

<p>
"Shouldn't wonder if the dominie's shadowin'
him," uncle ventured gravely; "lookin' for a job,
you see&mdash;this'll be worth two hundred to him at the
least, won't it, Helen?" as he looked quizzingly
at me.
</p>

<p>
"At the very least," I answered; "I'm pretty
expensive&mdash;as well as dear," which little playfulness
seemed to tickle uncle immensely.  He was proceeding
to expound the humour to the others when
mother interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"Run to the door and meet them, Helen.  And
bring them right out to the porch."
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather not," I demurred&mdash;"I'm shy."  But
the knocker had already sounded and Lyddie had
already started for the door.  Uncle Henry
immediately arose and made his way to meet our friends.
A minute later we were all mingled in a kind of
hand-shaking reel on the piazza.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Giddens and I met at the wharf," explained
Mr. Furvell; "we were both taking a look at our
noble river&mdash;it's superb in the morning sunshine.  So
we walked up together."
</p>

<p>
"Most happy to see you both, I'm sure," said my
Aunt Agnes cordially.
</p>

<p>
"Quite appropriate, I think, that we should hunt
in couples," continued Mr. Furvell, a significant
twinkle in the minister's eye; "we're here in
different capacities&mdash;yet they naturally go together," he
enlarged, evidently desiring to be questioned.
</p>

<p>
Everybody waited.  "Miss Helen will understand,"
he then went on facetiously; "you see, I'm
here as a preacher, and Mr. Giddens as a worshipper,"
wherewith, much pleased at the success of his little
jest, Mr. Furvell led the chorus of applause himself.
</p>

<p>
"Well, if you're as earnest about your part as I
am in mine, we've both found our proper callings,"
rejoined Mr. Giddens, making a courtly bow.
</p>

<p>
"Let's take up the collection," said I, blushing
furiously, and not knowing what else to say.
</p>

<p>
"That'll come later," interjected my uncle, winking
reverently at the pastor.  The pastor seemed to
understand right well and took it nothing amiss.
</p>

<p>
My mother's gaze was directed in undisguised
admiration upon Charlie.  And very handsome he
looked, I must admit, his face a little flushed by the
satisfaction of his happy speech, his eyes bright and
tender, his whole frame lithe and strong with
abundant health.  Then, besides, he had lovely clothes,
even though he was disfigured by two or three
blazing diamonds, two in his shirt-front, if I remember
right, and one on the little finger of his left hand.
But I shouldn't complain; for I had one brilliant beauty
on my own hand&mdash;and he was its devoted source.
</p>

<p>
I think Charlie must have noticed my mother's
steadfast gaze.  In any case her question came very
suddenly, as if to relieve embarrassment: "I hope
your folks are all well at home, Mr. Giddens."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, thank you, ma'am," he replied promptly;
"they're busy preparing for a long trip to
Europe&mdash;they sail next month."
</p>

<p>
Whereat my mother quite involuntarily threw a
swift glance at me.  And I believe, I'm almost sure,
that Charlie's eyes followed hers.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Giddens," I broke in, my burning cheeks
attesting that it was high time, "you don't know
who's coming to be our guest to-day&mdash;we're going to
have an elder."
</p>

<p>
"What on earth's that?" said Charlie, twirling an
ebony cane about with his fingers.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I forgot, you're not a Presbyterian.  It's a
man," I elucidated, "a kind of an unordained minister.
And he's going to stay here while the Presbytery's
meeting."
</p>

<p>
"Are they very solemn?" Charlie enquired;
"they sound solemn.  I suppose he's about the same
thing as we call a warden," for Charlie was an
Episcopalian.
</p>

<p>
"A notch higher," ventured Mr. Furvell; "they're
in for life.  I fancy an elder's more like a bishop than
anything you've got in your church."
</p>

<p>
"And he's going on the bridge deck," I added,
pointing upward through the porch roof.
</p>

<p>
"Helen means the attic," explained my Aunt
Agnes; "and it does seem too bad&mdash;but we can't
help it without turning everything upside down."
</p>

<p>
"He'll never notice it," Mr. Giddens remarked
assuringly.  "I know in Savannah, when we have those
church pow-wows, half the householders have to
sleep in the bath.  Is this bishop from the country?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe so," informed Mr. Furvell.  "I think
the Pollocksville elder is to be your man."
</p>

<p>
"You'll have no end of fun with him," Charlie
predicted.  "Those old Rubes are great.  I hope
you've got your bootjack handy, Mr. Lundy," addressing
my uncle; "the old chap will need it sure."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not reckonin' on much fun with him," Uncle
Henry answered dryly; "that's not our custom with
our guests.  And I haven't got the instrument you
mention&mdash;but I'll pull his boots off myself, if he wants
any help."
</p>

<p>
There was just the slightest flush on uncle's cheek;
hospitality was a sacred thing to him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, by the way," broke in Mr. Furvell, willing
enough to turn the talk into another channel, "I've
just had word that we're going to have an outsider
at the Presbytery.  Dr. Paine notified me to-day
that he's bringing an intimate friend that's visiting
him for a while.  I rather think he's from
Edinburgh&mdash;but I'm not sure of that.  In any case, he's
a cleric&mdash;and one of our own kind.  A young man, I
rather think; he wants to see something of our
Southern life, Dr. Paine's letter said."
</p>

<p>
"Where's he going to stay?" Aunt Agnes enquired
briskly.  My aunt kept the census of hosts
and visitors for half the town.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's just what I was going to speak
about," replied the minister.  "You see, we'll have
to get a place extra for him&mdash;unless he can be billeted
along with Dr. Paine, which I think rather unlikely.
And, if you all prefer it, I could send the elder
somewhere else, and give you the foreigner&mdash;just as you
like, though."
</p>

<p>
"Whatever you think best," said Aunt Agnes,
drawing her chair a little closer.  Such problems
were the luxuries of life to her.
</p>

<p>
I know not what impulse prompted me, but I recall,
as though it all happened yesterday, the quick
way I spoke up and said: "I believe we'll take the
Scotchman&mdash;I vote for the clergy."
</p>

<p>
"You can't," said my mother archly smiling.
"You're not attentive enough to them when we have
them here&mdash;your preference runs too distinctly along
other lines."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know about that," said I.  "Anyhow,
I'm for the clergy this time; I reckon it's the
Scotch flavour that catches me&mdash;and then perhaps he
knew Carlyle," for this latter had been long a
favourite of mine and I had enjoyed many a good
thrill&mdash;and many a good snooze&mdash;over his books.
</p>

<p>
Mother smiled.  "That's a little conceit of my
daughter's," she said apologetically to our visitors;
"she thinks she'll write a book herself some day."  Ah
me! how little she knew then that my only book
would be the story of my life, or so much of it as is
worth the telling.  And as I write the words I wonder
if any one will ever really read them&mdash;in a real
book.
</p>

<p>
"No, I fear he never saw Carlyle," informed Mr. Furvell;
"he's too young, I fancy.  At least, that's
the impression I got."
</p>

<p>
"Is he married?" Charlie suddenly broke in,
holding the ebony cane out before him as if in deadly
earnest.
</p>

<p>
"No, he's not&mdash;I'm quite sure of that part," the
minister answered promptly; "for Dr. Paine said I
mustn't have him stay where he'd be liable to catch
any affection of the heart."
</p>

<p>
"Then don't send him here," cried Charlie Giddens,
"for this is the danger zone."  And everybody
laughed but me.
</p>

<p>
"But really, speaking seriously, what do you think
we'd better do about it?" pressed my Aunt Agnes,
rising to adjust an awning that had got awry.  Mental
intensity with some women always runs to domestic
observation.  "I'd hate to put an Edinburgh minister
in the attic," she continued thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"The attic hasn't anything to do with it,"
pronounced Uncle Henry, silent hitherto.  "But I
say&mdash;I say," as he looked around the company, "it's
going to be the elder.  I've made up my mind to that&mdash;I
took a notion to this Pollocksville elder as soon
as I heard of him.  So we'll consider that settled,
Mr. Furvell, if you please.  I've got a queer kind of
a notion he's going to do us all good.  When does
his train arrive, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"This evening at five," said Mr. Furvell.  "I'll
have him driven up to the house."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, I'll meet the train myself," said my
uncle.
</p>

<p>
"But, Henry," his wife expostulated, "I made an
engagement for you for that very hour&mdash;Judge Burton
and his wife are coming to call."
</p>

<p>
"Can't help it," said my uncle firmly; "not when
there's a guest to be met.  I'll have to leave them to
the ladies," from which resolve my aunt knew well
no argument could turn him.
</p>

<p>
It was only a few minutes before our little
company broke up when Mr. Furvell rose to go.  Charlie
took advantage of the confusion to suggest that we
two should retire to the parlour.  "And you'll sing
for me," he said.
</p>

<p>
Half-way along the hall he remarked merrily:
"Now's your chance to begin your book, dear.  Put
your elder in it&mdash;and make the Edinburgh parson
die of a broken heart&mdash;and put me somewhere in the
introduction."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe I will," I answered a little defiantly.  "You
think I can't write, don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"You could do anything you like with
anything&mdash;or anybody," he answered gallantly; "but don't begin
your literary work till we come back from Europe,"
and his voice was all thrilling as he spoke, his eyes
ardent as they turned on me.  And his hand went
out and rested lovingly on mine as I turned the
music over&mdash;for we were now at the piano&mdash;and I
wondered why it was that I didn't lean forward like
he did with eager outstretched arms.  But I didn't.
Yet he kissed me&mdash;then I said I was going to sing,
as he had asked me, so it was all over in a minute.
</p>

<p>
"Sing that about the tresses," he whispered, bending
over me.  So I did as he bade me.  And the
words came softly:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Still must you call me tender names,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still gently stroke my tresses."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
But somehow I kept thinking about the elder that
was so soon to come.  I know not why&mdash;it was
through no will of mine&mdash;but the elder would take
shape before me as about five-and-twenty years of
age; and he was fair; and his accent was like to that
of the Scotch Carlyle; and he had a low-crowned
hat of felt&mdash;and a coat of clerical design.
</p>

<br /><br />
<i>AN ALTERNATIVE</i>
</h3>

<p>
Some things never happen more than once.
And these one never can forget.
</p>

<p>
I remember exactly what I wore that evening;
what it was, is of no consequence to any one
but me.  I have a few fragments of it yet, tatters
mostly&mdash;but their colour never seems to fade.
</p>

<p>
And I can recall the errand that took me forth.
It was to get some cream; for what we had didn't
know when it was whipped.  Such was the simple
mission on which I started out, and I had a little
pitcher in my hand; even then the days were almost
past in which a Southern girl thought such a thing
beneath her.
</p>

<p>
I hadn't gone very far when I saw Uncle Henry
coming towards me.  He was evidently homeward
bound, returning from the train.  And there was
somebody with him; I could see a tall form, clothed
in black, beside him&mdash;and uncle, to my surprise,
was carrying a valise.
</p>

<p>
I don't know why it was, but instantly my pace
slackened till I stood almost still.  And once I
turned and looked back towards the house; I think
I held the pitcher out in front of me as if I were
pointing with it.  I really believe I was contemplating
a retreat, but just then uncle sang out something
in his cheery way; this let me know I was recognized
and expected, whereat I walked calmly on to
meet them.
</p>

<p>
As I came closer I kept my eyes fixed as steadfastly
on uncle as though I had been looking for him
all my life.  I believe I bowed to him as he came
up; how ridiculous it all seems now.
</p>

<p>
"Where are you off to, Helen?" he asked, glancing
at the jug.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to Humphrey's," I said, gazing into
the empty pitcher; "going for cream&mdash;ours at home
won't whip."  Then I felt how silly this must sound
to a stranger.  For I knew, without being told, that
this was no country elder, and that he had never
heard of Pollocksville.
</p>

<p>
"Let me introduce Mr. Lord," said my uncle, paying
no further attention to my remark; "the Reverend
Mr. Lord&mdash;the friend of Dr. Paine's that Mr. Furvell
told us about.  He's to be our guest.  Mr. Lord,
this is my niece, Miss Helen Randall."
</p>

<p>
The stranger lifted his hat&mdash;it was a low-crowned
felt&mdash;and bowed.  His bow was deferential enough,
but it lacked the Southern touch.  Less low, less
obeisant, sooner finished.  And he seemed rather
surprised when I extended my hand&mdash;I noticed how
firm and strong was his&mdash;and he didn't bow low
again when he took it, as a Southern man would
have done.  Nor did he hold his hat in his hand
while we spoke together; this I remarked particularly.
</p>

<p>
"My name's not Lord, Mr. Lundy," he said with
a smile as he turned from me; "it's Laird&mdash;not a
great difference, I'll admit.  Only that's the Scotch
of it."
</p>

<p>
"Is that so?" said my uncle interestedly.  "They
do sound something alike, don't they?  Perhaps I'm
further wrong," he went on smilingly; "it just
occurs to me I should say Dr. Laird.  Are you a
doctor, sir?" enquired Uncle Henry respectfully.
</p>

<p>
The other smiled.  "No," he answered slowly,
"I'm quite undecorated.  You see, D.D.'s aren't
quite so&mdash;so generously distributed," the smile
widening, "on our side of the water.  You've either
got to be very brilliant&mdash;or very prosy&mdash;to get one
there."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure you're not one of those two," declared
my uncle.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to know which one," said the stranger;
"however, we'll lave it go at that, as an Irish friend
of mine says.  But anyhow, I'm not a doctor&mdash;very
plain name mine is, Mr. Lundy; just plain Laird,
Gordon Laird.  Let me carry that bag," he suddenly
digressed, reaching for the valise; "it's pretty
heavy&mdash;two or three sermons there, you know."
</p>

<p>
His offer of assistance was stoutly rejected, as any
one who knew Uncle Henry could easily have foretold.
</p>

<p>
I was silent all this time.  But I was busy making
notes; and my pen flows easily, as if its story were
of yesterday, while I record the impressions that
came so fast and have remained so long.  I recall
how strange the Scottish voice sounded to me, not
harsh and strident as I thought all Scottish voices
were, but refined and cultured.  The way he rolled
his "r's" and sounded his final "ings" was in
decided contrast to our Southern way of slurring the
one and mincing the other.  Rather pleasing, too, I
thought it.  He was tall&mdash;taller than uncle&mdash;and his
figure was of athletic build, erect and supple, as if he
had given himself freely to exercise out-of-doors.
Especially noticeable were the shoulders, so broad
and so well held back, giving the chest an appearance
of greater expansion than it really had.  But I
think the face impressed me most of all.  It was
ruddy, as the sea-polished faces of those Scotchmen
are so apt to be; a strong Scottish face it was, serious,
almost stern when in repose&mdash;all Scotchmen naturally
think much about Eternity&mdash;and yet the lips,
thin and mobile, looked as if laughter were never far
away.  The mouth was really remarkable, evidently
framed for public speech, although its proximity to
a very resolute jaw lent it a look of Scottish fixity
that really wasn't there at all, even if he was the
Reverend Gordon Laird.  His forehead was high&mdash;a
little too narrow, I thought, to meet my view of
what Carlyle would have admired&mdash;and evidently
harboured much within; for I have a theory that
foreheads shine if there is anything bright behind them,
as cathedral windows are lightened by an altar
fire.  This high brow lost itself in a very comely
head of hair; auburn, I must frankly state it was, but
a very superior kind of auburn, the semi-ruddy
wavelets having half a mind to curl after a fashion of
youthful days.  I verily believe they would have
curled, had it not been for the close-buttoned vest
and clerical coat he wore; these canonicals never
could have kept their dignity in the neighbourhood
of kinky hair.  The nose was big, as all the best
men's noses are.  It stood out in a personal kind of
way, like an independent promontory; and it had
the slightest little terminal tilt&mdash;it wasn't turned up,
it was aspiring.
</p>

<p>
This, I think, describes fairly well the man who was
not an elder and had never heard of Pollocksville.
All except the eyes, which deserve a separate
paragraph.  In fact, there would be no paragraphs and
no chapters and no literature at all, were it not for
the eyes of men&mdash;women too&mdash;and all that lies
behind the eyes, all the soul of things and the passion
of life and the foregleams of Eternity.  Well, the
eyes of the Reverend Gordon Laird were just such as
the Reverend Gordon Laird had a right to have.
I'm sure there is no Presbytery in Christendom, nor
any bishop, nor any other human judge or authority
who could as well determine just what brand of eyes
would match that particular name, as could a simple
maiden who had never met this certain sort of man
before.  And I thought the eyes and the name were
a perfect match.  They&mdash;the eyes, I mean&mdash;were
nearer brown than anything else; the kind of eyes
that could never be content to be one particular
hue&mdash;they seemed to have got their blend from the sky,
which, as everybody knows, selects no colour but
takes toll of all.  And they were frank, so frank and
honest&mdash;eager, too, inquisitive, in a reverent sort of
way; penetrating they seemed to be&mdash;the more
penetrating because they were rather veiled&mdash;and they
looked to be in quest of truth, and love, and life.
Yes, life; I think the eyes of the Reverend Gordon
Laird had more of life in them than any others I
have ever seen&mdash;not bright, or animated, or brilliant,
or anything of that sort; but life, with all its mystery
and loneliness and longing, seemed to lie deep in
them, like water in a silent well.
</p>

<p>
The two men went on their way a moment later,
uncle swinging the valise quite playfully to show
how light it was.  "I hope to see you later," said
the Reverend Gordon Laird as I started on; "and
perhaps I'll be introduced to that cream you're
going to get," he added, in quite a non ministerial way.
</p>

<p>
"Not till it's whipped," said I, holding the pitcher
in both hands.
</p>

<p>
"That's when it'll be good," replied the cleric,
something of the moralist in his voice this time.
</p>

<p>
I had gone but a little way when I suddenly
stopped, looked back, calculated.  For an idea had
come to me&mdash;and I knew a short cut home.  A
hasty flight through a neighbour's yard, straight
under an old pine tree that George Washington was
credited with planting, along a narrow alley that led
to our back garden, would bring me there before
those deliberate two would have arrived.
</p>

<p>
Three minutes later I was in the sitting-room,
breathless almost.  "It's a minister," I said, "a
young minister&mdash;and he's Scotch as heather."  I
have often wondered since where I got this
expression; but I believe I heard it from old
McLaughlin.  He was the only Scotchman in our
whole town, and he always wore a shawl to church,
and put a penny on the plate.
</p>

<p>
"Who?" said Aunt Agnes and my mother in
unison.  They were both in black silk, for they
knew it was train time.  And my aunt had donned
two real tortoise-shell combs that came from
Tiffany's.
</p>

<p>
"Our elder," I gasped, standing the pitcher on
the mantel; "he isn't an elder at all.  He's a
minister&mdash;with one of those vests that fit around the
throat like a sweater&mdash;the same as the Episcopalians
wear&mdash;and fair hair.  And I ran back to tell you
not to put him in the attic," I concluded, lifting my
eyes heavenward as I spoke.
</p>

<p>
"A sweater vest and fair hair!" my aunt echoed
in mock gravity; "is that all he has on?"
</p>

<p>
"Not put him in the attic?" exclaimed my
mother, scornful of merriment at such an hour;
"why shouldn't we put him there&mdash;where would
you have him put?"
</p>

<p>
"Any of the rooms," I answered promptly; "my
room."
</p>

<p>
"Mercy, child, we'd have to get all your things
out of it and turn everything upside down," my
mother returned seriously, "and they'll be here
in a few minutes.  What happened to the elder?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  I don't remember.  Uncle did
say something about why he didn't come&mdash;I think
he's sick, or dead, or something.  But I'm not sure.
And we can easily keep Mr. Laird down-stairs till
we get things changed around.  It wouldn't need
much&mdash;men never look into drawers and closets like
women do," I assured them.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Laird!" echoed both my auditors almost in
chorus.  "Is that his name?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said, "his name's Laird&mdash;Gordon
Laird."
</p>

<p>
"Goodness me!" exclaimed my mother, "but
you've made good progress.  I hope you didn't
call him Gordon.  How old is he?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," I retorted, treating the thrust
with silence, "and I don't care&mdash;I don't care
anything about him.  You know I'm not much on
preachers&mdash;and anyhow, I'm going to the theatre
to-night with Charlie.  But I took all this trouble
for your sakes," I went on in a rather injured tone;
"I didn't suppose you'd want to coop anybody like
him up at the top of the house.  But I don't care,"
I concluded vehemently.
</p>

<p>
My Aunt Agnes was at the window.  "They're
coming," she announced, without turning her head.
"Your Uncle Henry certainly should have sent
Moses for that valise&mdash;and he certainly is tall."
</p>

<p>
Mother by this time was at the window too.
"He isn't any taller than Mr. Giddens," she
pronounced, after a little silence.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what are you going to do about it?" I
said, a trifle petulantly, for they both seemed to have
forgotten I was there.
</p>

<p>
"Really I hardly know," my aunt began reflectively;
"it does seem hardly the thing to&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There's no use talking about it," my mother
broke in; "it's too late to make any change now.
And anyhow, Henry wouldn't like it, I'm sure&mdash;he'd
think it wasn't fair to the elder."
</p>

<p>
"Sacred to the memory of the elder from
Pollocksville," chanted my aunt solemnly.
</p>

<p>
"All right," I said, reaching towards the mantel for
the pitcher, "just as you like.  He's not my
guest&mdash;and I'm going for the cream."
</p>

<p>
And I reflected as I went&mdash;or if I didn't, I have
often done so since&mdash;how full is life of this same
proceeding.  Thwarted plans and broken promises
and disappointed hopes&mdash;yet all that remains for us
is to take up our humdrum tasks again, to pick up
our waiting pitcher and go our way through some
back alley and across some homely yard&mdash;for the
cream.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
They were still on the porch when I got back.
And Mr. Laird was swinging away in one of the big
easy chairs, as much at home as if he had known us
all his life.  His hat was lying on the floor and his
hair was hardly a bit red in the failing light.  He
rose as I came on to the porch.
</p>

<p>
"Did you get the cream?" he asked seriously, as
if it were a matter of importance.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," I said, "Lyn's thrashing away at it by
this time.  She's our cook, you know," I added
informatively.
</p>

<p>
"I'm vastly interested in these darkies," he said as
we both sat down.  "We have very few of them in
Edinburgh&mdash;the thermometer doesn't agree with
them.  They're quite a study, aren't they?"
pointing as he spoke to a sable boy who was carrying a
pail across the yard.
</p>

<p>
"You'll find the life here very different, won't you,
sir?" my uncle remarked; "but I suppose you hear
a great deal, even in Scotland, of what's called the
'Nigger problem,' don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," returned our visitor, "we're reminded of it
rather startlingly sometimes&mdash;by what we see in the
newspapers.  But I suppose such despatches&mdash;about
lynch law, I mean&mdash;are decidedly exaggerated."
</p>

<p>
Uncle's face clouded a little.  "I never saw any
of your papers, of course," he said; "but I should
fancy 'twould be difficult to exaggerate much about
some things that have happened in the South, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Then there must be some terrible scenes of
brutality," rejoined Mr. Laird, looking about the
circle in an evident attempt to make the conversation
general.
</p>

<p>
"That depends on what you call brutality, sir,"
my uncle answered, his voice suddenly intense, his
eyes fixed very earnestly on his guest.  "We reckon
here, sir&mdash;all Southern gentlemen reckon&mdash;that
people who have only heard of these things, and who are
not&mdash;who aren't familiar with the situation; we
reckon, sir, that they're hardly justified in
pronouncing an opinion."
</p>

<p>
I think Aunt Agnes must have scented danger
ahead.  In any case she suddenly gave the conversation
a mighty jerk in another direction.  "Oh, by the
way, Henry," she began, as if it had everything to do
with the race question, "have you any idea what
happened the elder from Pollocksville?"
</p>

<p>
If uncle felt any surprise at the rather violent
digression he concealed it remarkably well.  "Yes,"
he answered calmly.  "Mr. Furvell got word about
him at the last minute.  It seems he has thirteen
children, and one got lost&mdash;you'd think he had
enough left, wouldn't you?  But he got in quite a
fuss about it, and that's why he wasn't able to get
away.  So we'd have been left without a guest
altogether if our friend hadn't happened along," and my
uncle made a courtly little bow in the direction of
Mr. Laird.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see," said the latter, evidently very
interested.  "I'm an alternative then.  Well, I'm here
anyhow&mdash;and that's the main thing."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, Mr. Laird, there was no alternative about
it," broke in my aunt, "nothing of the sort.  If our
elder had come you were to go with Dr. Paine to
Mrs. Keen's&mdash;and then we'd have lost you," smiling
very sweetly as she spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Weel," replied Mr. Laird jocosely, "'it's an ill
wind that blaws naebody guid,' as they say in my
country.  If it hadn't been for that youngster
straying away, I wouldn't have been here.  So I'm an
advocate of large families from this time on."
</p>

<p>
"So am I," said my Aunt Agnes.
</p>

<p>
"But there's a matter in connection with the elder
we expected," my mother began rather timidly,
"and it's something that's troubling us a little."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Laird looked as if he would like to be enlightened.
</p>

<p>
"And I may just as well tell you now," went on
my mother; "it's about where we were going to put
him&mdash;and that's where we have to put you."
</p>

<p>
"That's the worst of it," ejaculated my Aunt Agnes.
</p>

<p>
"You see," resumed my mother, "we thought you
were going to be an elder&mdash;and we were going to put
him in the attic," the dread tidings coming at last
with a splash.  "And we do hope you won't mind,
Mr. Laird&mdash;you see if we had ever thought&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We won't make any apologies to our guest," my
uncle now broke in, his tone indicating that he
wouldn't object to being heard.  "You're welcome as
the flowers in May, Mr. Laird&mdash;and there's a
fireplace in your room in the attic.  I may be wrong,
but it's always seemed to me if a fellow's got a
welcome and an open fire, the attic's just as good as the
parlour."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Laird looked delighted.  "I'm in love with it
already," he responded gleefully; "I wouldn't trade
it for any room in the house.  I couldn't imagine,"
he went on mirthfully, "what was coming.  I
thought it must be the dog-kennel, or a dark closet,
or a wood-shed; but an attic&mdash;and a fireplace!  Why,
bless my heart, there's nothing in the world I love
like an attic&mdash;secluded, lofty, roomy&mdash;it's the best
place in the house.  Let us see it now."
</p>

<p>
"Where's Moses?" said my uncle; "he'll take your
valise up for you.  It's plain, but it's comfortable,
Mr. Laird.  And if you like it, there's just one way
I want you to show it."
</p>

<p>
"And what might that be?" asked our visitor.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be in any hurry about leaving," said my
uncle with serious air.
</p>

<p>
"No, we'll think you don't like it if you are,"
chimed in my aunt.
</p>

<p>
"Where's Moses?" asked uncle again.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know where Moses is," said the Reverend
Gordon Laird, his face as sober as a judge, "but one
thing I do know&mdash;I've heard of Southern hospitality,
and the half was never told."
</p>

<p>
Uncle bowed; Aunt Agnes smiled graciously.  As
for me, I had disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"What have you been up to now?  You certainly
did get out of the way in a hurry&mdash;you've been up to
the attic yourself, haven't you, now?" for mother
saw that I was flurried and out of breath when I
returned.
</p>

<p>
It was a little while before I owned up.  But I
reckoned they'd find out sooner or later anyhow.
"Well," I said at last, "yes, if you will know.  I ran
up and put my silver toilet set on the dresser&mdash;it
helped ever so much to make things look decent.
And I took up those roses from the library&mdash;they
make the whole room look different."
</p>

<p>
"Those roses!" my mother echoed; "why, child,
Mr. Giddens sent you those roses just this
morning&mdash;they're American beauties, Helen."
</p>

<p>
"I know it," I answered calmly, "so they'll be
something new&mdash;to him.  Besides, there's some
respect due a clergyman from Edinburgh."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>

<br /><br />
<i>THE GLINT OF THE HEATHER</i>
</h3>

<p>
Charlie dropped in for supper that
evening.  I don't remember whether or not he
was specially invited and it doesn't matter.
He came while everybody except myself was in the
last stages of preparation for the evening meal; I was
in the hall as he came in.
</p>

<p>
The first thing that caught his eye&mdash;after me&mdash;was
the clerical hat that hung between two of uncle's
broad-rimmed grays.  He put it on and made very
merry over it.  It was decidedly too large for him
too; as soon as he noticed that, he tipped it jauntily
to the back of his head&mdash;even then it looked big.
The Reverend Gordon's attic was certainly the best
room in his bodily edifice.
</p>

<p>
"Your elder didn't turn up?" said Charlie.
</p>

<p>
"No, he didn't come."
</p>

<p>
"And you got the clergyman?"
</p>

<p>
I nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Up-stairs right now?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"In the attic?"
</p>

<p>
"That's where he is."
</p>

<p>
Charlie returned the hat to its peg.  Then he took
off his overcoat, disclosing a faultless evening dress,
for the theatre was our objective point that night.
</p>

<p>
"What kind of a cove is this parson?" he enquired
carelessly.
</p>

<p>
"He's about your age," said I.
</p>

<p>
"Nice?"
</p>

<p>
"Uncle thinks so," I answered cautiously.
</p>

<p>
"How does your mother like him&mdash;has she looked
him over?"
</p>

<p>
"I really don't know&mdash;he's only been here an hour
or two.  You certainly do look nice to-night, Charlie."
</p>

<p>
"How long is this cleric going to stay?" he pursued.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  I heard uncle telling him to stay
as long as he could."
</p>

<p>
"What denomination is he?"
</p>

<p>
"Belongs to the true church," said I.
</p>

<p>
"I thought Mr. Furvell said he was Presbyterian."
</p>

<p>
"So he is&mdash;he's from Edinburgh.  And he's vastly
interested in the darkies.  They don't grow 'em over
there, it seems.  He got on pretty thin ice with
uncle&mdash;they were talking the nigger problem."
</p>

<p>
"They must have been hard up for conversation,"
said Mr. Giddens, with a little curl of the lip.
</p>

<p>
"But they weren't," I protested; "he's a splendid
talker&mdash;hush, there he's coming now," as I heard a
footfall on the stair.  "Come and meet him."
</p>

<p>
I introduced the two men to each other.  They
stood talking a little in the hall&mdash;and I watched them
while I listened.  Charlie was in full dress, as I have
said, with diamond accompaniment; Mr. Laird was
in his clericals.  They stood close together, chatting
very pleasantly; I thought I had never seen two finer
types of men, both strong and straight and tall&mdash;though
Charlie wasn't quite so tall.  The Southerner
had the keenest face, I thought, bright and animated,
with eager, penetrating eyes, and his whole bearing
was that of a high-minded and successful man of the
world.  They were discussing "futures" at the time,
I think, suggested doubtless by preliminary remarks
about the weather and the prospect of the cotton
crop.  I know I was surprised to observe that the
Reverend Gordon Laird was by no means ignorant
of the subject; strange subject, too, when you come
to think of it&mdash;<i>futures</i>, which comprise a great deal
more than cotton!
</p>

<p>
Perhaps Charlie had the keener face, as I have
said, but there was more of insight in Mr. Laird's.
His were the more wistful eyes, as if they were
looking for something not to be found on the surface.
And really, of the two, the Scotchman seemed to be
doing the most of the inspecting; I mean, by that, that
Charlie didn't appear to have the slightest chance to
patronize him, as business men are so apt to do with
clergymen.  For the minister, his clerical coat and
collar to the contrary notwithstanding, impressed one
as having a certain order of business that was just as
important as the other's; and he seemed to pride
himself on it, too, in a reserved sort of way.  In fact,
I should hardly say this at all, since I don't know
exactly how I could defend it&mdash;but there was an
undefinable something about him that made one feel
Mr. Laird reckoned his work quite as necessary to
the world's good as that of any prosperous business
man, even of a wealthy ship-owner from Savannah.
</p>

<p>
"Have you been long in our country, sir?" Mr. Giddens
took advantage of the first pause to enquire.
</p>

<p>
"No," said the other.  "I'm quite a tenderfoot&mdash;it's
only two weeks since I landed at New York.  I
came straight South to see Dr. Paine; he took a
post-graduate session in Edinburgh, and I met him
there.  We scraped up quite a friendship&mdash;and that's
how I came to visit him."
</p>

<p>
"Do you sail from New York, returning, Mr. Laird?"
I ventured, thinking I ought to bear some
part in the conversation.
</p>

<p>
"That's all very uncertain," he answered thoughtfully;
"I've been in communication with the
Colonial Committee; and it's just possible I may take
work in Canada.  They're sorely in need of men
there, it seems."
</p>

<p>
"It's a wonderful country," pronounced Charlie;
"I spent a week once between Montreal and Quebec.
There's untold wealth in Canada, if it were only
exploited."
</p>

<p>
"That's what I have heard," said Mr. Laird; "and
I'd like to lend a hand," he added quietly, the
earnestness of his eyes interpreting his words.  But
Charlie evidently did not understand him.
</p>

<p>
"You mean in the way of investment, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the Reverend Gordon Laird; "yes, I
guess that's it&mdash;yes, investment."
</p>

<p>
This somewhat enigmatical conversation was
terminated by the advent of the other members of the
family, all quite ready for the supper that was
waiting.  And a decidedly animated circle it was that
surrounded our well-laden board.  Uncle was in fine
spirits, as he ever was when he had congenial
company, and the honours of his attention were pretty
evenly divided between the Scotchman and the
Southerner.
</p>

<p>
It was delightful to watch the interest and surprise
of our clerical guest, so new and different did
everything appear to him.  For our dear Southland has
fashions all its own, each one of them more delicious
than another.  Perhaps this is especially true of what
we eat, and of how we go about it.  We had a
coloured boy with a long feather fan whose duty it was
to guard us from the flies.  This amused him vastly;
especially once when my aunt motioned him to look&mdash;the
dusky Washington was almost asleep, leaning
against the wall.  And so many of our dishes seemed
to strike the foreigner as the newest and most
palatable things on earth.  We had the savoury rock in
little fish-shaped dishes&mdash;they looked all ready to
swim&mdash;and sweet potatoes and corn bread and
fried chicken, and hot biscuits too, and a lot of other
things Scotchmen never see.  It was lovely to watch
Aunt Agnes' face, brightening with every recurring
exclamation of surprise or pleasure from our visitor.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand he was hardly less interesting
to us.  A really new type is something to which a
little Southern town is seldom treated&mdash;we are so
fearfully native-born.  And Gordon Laird (the
Reverend can't be always used) seemed to bring with
him the flavour of the world without.  His accent
was so different, as I have said; and many of his
terms were so unfamiliar to us.  For instance, we
soon remarked that he referred to the Episcopal
church as the Church of England; and once or twice
he spoke of the "Kirk Session," which had to be
explained; and he rarely used the term "pastor," or
"preacher," as we did&mdash;it was always "minister"
with him.  It was most interesting, too, to hear him
talk of Edinburgh, of its castle, its Holyrood, its
Princes Street, its Scott's monument, its haunts of
Knox and memories of Burns.
</p>

<p>
"Fo' de Lawd, Miss Helen, dat new preacher, he's
got a heap o' learnin'," Lyddie said one day, "an' he
knows how to let it out, dat's sho'."
</p>

<p>
That very first night, that first supper, I mean,
found us all listening with great intentness to his
description of much we had hardly ever heard of
before.  I remember he spoke of higher criticism,
giving the names of two or three great Scottish scholars,
and he seemed a little disappointed to find we had
never heard of the latter and but little more than
heard of the former.  He spoke, it seemed to me, as
if this higher criticism were a matter of great
importance, almost as if it were troubling his own
soul&mdash;but this I did not understand till long after.
</p>

<p>
The discussion ran so steadily along church lines
that even Charlie, who was not very strong on
matters ecclesiastical, contributed a question.
</p>

<p>
"What church does your Queen belong to,
Mr. Laird?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"To the Presbyterian," replied our guest, looking
very candidly at the questioner; "when she is in
Scotland, that is."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Charlie, "I always thought she
belonged to the State church."
</p>

<p>
"So she does," replied the other, "and that is the
State church of Scotland."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Helen thinks that's fine," broke in my
uncle.  "I'm sure her far-off ancestors must have
been Scotch Presbyterians, Mr. Laird.  She's a
regular Puritan&mdash;in theory."
</p>

<p>
"Then you'll be going to the service at the opening
of Presbytery to-night, Miss Randall," said
Mr. Laird, turning to me.
</p>

<p>
I was silent, not knowing just what to say.  Yet
I felt that uncle's statement was quite just all the
time.  For, ever since a child, I had had a kind of
passionate devotion to the church of my fathers;
yet it is only fair to add that if there was one girl
in all our town who would not have been called
religious, who would, in fact, have been called a gay
society girl&mdash;what a poor garish definition that
seems to me now!&mdash;I was that very one.
</p>

<p>
"What her uncle says about Helen reminds me
of something I must tell you, Mr. Laird," began my
mother, breaking the silence that had followed his
rather pointed question.  "I always taught her the
Shorter Catechism when she was a little girl&mdash;made
her learn it, at least&mdash;and one Sunday afternoon I
was following her around the yard trying to get her
to answer what is Sanctification; well, she suddenly
turned to me, and what do you think she said?"
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't imagine, I'm sure," answered Mr. Laird.
</p>

<p>
"'What's the use, mother,' she said, 'of teaching
me all this&mdash;when perhaps I won't marry a
Presbyterian at all?'"
</p>

<p>
"All the more need of it then," replied our
guest amid the laugh that followed; "it won't be
wasted anyhow, whoever the lucky man may be.
It's wonderful how that catechism stays with you,
when once it gets in the blood.  I learned it on the
hills of Scotland," he went on, his deep eyes
brightening as if the memory gave him joy, "and I
hardly ever wander now in wild or lonely regions
without its great words coming back to me.  They
go well together, I always think&mdash;they're both lofty."
</p>

<p>
"On the hills?" echoed Mr. Giddens, who had
never lived outside the city; "did your father send
you there to learn it?&mdash;pretty hard lines, I should say."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," Mr. Laird answered simply, "my work
lay there.  I used to take care of sheep on the
hills&mdash;I was a herd laddie, as they call them in Scotland.
My father is a shepherd."
</p>

<p>
I felt, rather than saw, the consternation that came
on every face.
</p>

<p>
"What did you say about your father?" my
uncle asked involuntarily, looking up impulsively
from his plate.  Now, uncle was a gentleman, if
ever one was born, but this intimation fairly swept
him off his feet.  "You were speaking about your
father, were you not?" he amended, thinking the
question more delicate in this form.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Mr. Laird, evidently quite unconscious
of having caused a sensation.  "I was saying
my father is a shepherd.  He takes care, along with
other herds, of the gentlemen's flocks in Scotland&mdash;in
Midlothian.  The shepherd gets so many sheep for
himself each year&mdash;that's part of his hire, you see."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, I see," rejoined my uncle.  "Have
some more of the ice-cream, Mr. Laird.  Washington,
pass the ice-cream to the gentleman."  It
was funny, had it not been so real, to see uncle's
consternation.  This was something new to my patrician
relative.
</p>

<p>
"Do let me help you to a little more of this
chocolate cake," broke in my aunt.
</p>

<p>
"And your coffee cup is empty," added my
mother.  Both showed the sudden perturbation that
had laid hold of uncle, for which the only outlet was
this sudden freshet of hospitality.
</p>

<p>
"No, thank you," our guest answered quietly,
"I've had quite enough&mdash;you Southerners would
soon kill a man with kindness.  Yes," he went on,
resuming the interrupted theme, "the catechism
goes well with the shepherd's crook; if there's any
one calling in the world that's been productive of
plain living and high thinking, it's the shepherd's."
</p>

<p>
"Half of that programme appeals to me," laughed
Charlie Giddens, helping himself generously to the
chocolate cake.  "I'm afraid I'd make a poor
shepherd."  Charlie seemed unable to keep his eyes
from Mr. Laird's face; this candour of biography was
quite beyond him.
</p>

<p>
"But it's a fact," our Scotch visitor went on quite
earnestly; "it's wonderful the difference there has
been, as a class, between the shepherds and the
ploughmen, in Scotland.  The shepherds have been
so much superior; their eyes were constantly lifted
to the hills, you see, and the others had to keep
theirs on the ground.  Besides, their work developed
a sense of responsibility&mdash;and it took a tender man
to make a good shepherd.  Oh, yes, the shepherds
of Scotland have been a noble race of men."
</p>

<p>
"And your father is still living in Scotland?"
enquired my mother from across the table.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he answered; "yes, he's still living."
</p>

<p>
"That's a phase of life we haven't been privileged
to see," my uncle remarked, concluding quite a
lengthy silence; "indeed, we haven't seen anything
of your Scottish life at all.  I have often thought I'd
love especially to see Edinburgh."
</p>

<p>
"I'd sooner see the shepherds on the hills," cried
I.  "I'd love to see the heather&mdash;and the mists
rolling back over the mountains, like I've read about in
Scott."
</p>

<p>
"Have you never been to the old world, Miss
Helen?" our guest enquired of me.
</p>

<p>
"No, never," I replied; "I've never been from
under the stars and stripes."
</p>

<p>
"But she's contemplating a European trip,
Mr. Laird," Mr. Giddens broke in, looking very
knowingly at me.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," chimed my mother, a playful smile lurking
about her mouth, "perhaps you'll meet over there
before very long."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Laird turned and looked at me.  I know my
face betrayed me.  But if he put two and two
together he didn't give us the result.  "I hope you'll
bring your mother with you when you come," was
all he said.
</p>

<p>
"But Mrs. Randall's a poor sailor," quoth Charlie
Giddens.
</p>

<p>
"So am I," was my remark.
</p>

<p>
"Then you must choose a fair-weather season for
your voyage," pressed Charlie, maintaining an
excellent gravity.
</p>

<p>
"But you can't always tell," said I.  "Often the
storms don't come till you get out to sea."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
VII
<br /><br />
<i>THE GLORY OF THEIR STRENGTH</i>
</h3>

<p>
We went to the theatre that night, Charlie
and I, as we had arranged.  But one-half
of us didn't enjoy it very much.  The
play was a light, frivolous thing, and I so defined it
to Charlie before the second act was through.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you liked the gay and festive sort," he
said; "I do believe this preachers' convocation is
having a depressing influence on you," which remark
I resented not a little; whatever my weaknesses were,
I knew susceptibility to the clergy was not one of them.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing of the sort," I retorted; "but the thing
isn't true to life&mdash;life was never one long cackle like
that.  Besides, they haven't any fire on, and it's
cold&mdash;and I'm going home after the next act."
</p>

<p>
Which I did, sure enough, and took Charlie with
me.  Our seats were near the front; and I must
confess I did enjoy our procession down the aisle.  I
could see the looks of admiration on every hand&mdash;of
envy, too, from some maidenly and matronly eyes.
</p>

<p>
Charlie was so tall and straight and handsome, and
had such an original head of hair.  Besides, most of
our townspeople knew he was an aristocrat&mdash;our
little city made a specialty of aristocracy&mdash;and
absolutely all of them knew that he was rich.  The
darkies had a good deal to do with this, I fancy.
My admirer had come from far away, from a city,
too, and all the sons of Ham invest the stranger from
a distance with the glory of wealth untold.  But
white folks aren't so very different after all; it's a
very odd sort of girl that doesn't take some satisfaction
out of these far-travelled pilgrims that come
hundreds of miles, and stay several days at the best
hotel, just to worship at her feet.  A local sweetheart
is all very well in his way&mdash;but the whole town
doesn't know when he comes.  Besides, it's so
convenient for the local to pay his homage that it may
mean very much or very little.  But when a lover
comes across a couple of states, leaving behind him
a big city&mdash;and all the girls that are sorry to see
him go, that's the best of it&mdash;that is something else,
as we used to say in the South.  It means his
temperature must be about a hundred and twenty in the
shade, as I have heard Uncle Henry say many a time.
</p>

<p>
Yes, I was proud enough of Charlie as we walked
the full length of the theatre that night, he keeping
close behind and carrying my white opera cloak on
his arm.  I remember an old maid&mdash;and they are
the best authority on such matters&mdash;telling me that
Charlie had a very caressing way of carrying a cloak,
as if it were a sacred thing.  I have thought quite a
little over this, and I believe there's something in it.
</p>

<p>
I cannot say I was sorry when I heard voices in
the library as we came in the house.  And that's a
bad sign when a girl's in love.  There should be no
such music to a love-lorn pair as dead silence in the
library when they come home through the dark.
When the poet sang of voices of the night I'm sure
he meant just two.
</p>

<p>
The Presbytery meeting was evidently over, for
they were all home, Mr. Furvell among them.  Now
I should have said at the outset that Mr. Furvell,
although he was our pastor and much beloved at that,
was really quite a Puritan of a man.  And I was
sure, as soon as he shook hands with me that night,
that he was concerned about my soul.
</p>

<p>
"Did you enjoy the play, Miss Helen?" he said,
looking as solemnly at me as though I had spent the
evening where Dives was when he asked for a drop
of water to cool his tongue.
</p>

<p>
"No," said I, "it was a fool play," whereat
Mr. Furvell looked a little comforted.
</p>

<p>
"We had a beautiful service at the Presbytery," he
went on, his solemnity but little diluted; "the Lord
was with us, Miss Helen," with an intonation that
implied a monopoly.  "You'd have been more
profited if you had been there.  Don't you think so,
Mr. Laird?"
</p>

<p>
I fancy none of us learned much from our visitor's
reply.  Whatever it was, it was quite evasive; but I
remember that he looked at me instead of his
questioner&mdash;and I felt a little rising anger that my own
minister should have put me in this light before a
stranger.  He would have found out what a frivolous
heathen I was quite soon enough, I thought, without
any assistance of this kind from Mr. Furvell.  The
conversation seemed to flag a little after this, and it
wasn't very long till Charlie and I slipped off into
the library.  I didn't slip as cheerfully as Charlie.
And he hadn't got more than well begun upon a
general criticism of Mr. Laird before uncle knocked at
the door&mdash;uncle was a very cautious man&mdash;"We're
going to have prayers; will you and Mr. Giddens
come in to worship?"
</p>

<p>
Charlie gave a little gasp.  "We're at our devotions
right now ourselves," he said, so low that uncle
could not hear.  Then we had a swift little debate.
I was for prayers, and Charlie said he believed they
had brought that whole Presbytery together just to
convert me.  Which, I retorted, would be like training
all the guns of the American navy on one little
house fly.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, we went in&mdash;even Charlie couldn't have
done anything else&mdash;and the Reverend Gordon Laird
had the Bible in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Do you sing?" he suddenly enquired, looking up
from the book.
</p>

<p>
"Who?" asked my Aunt Agnes, quite amazed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I mean, do you have singing at family
worship?  It's a very common custom in Scotland&mdash;they
usually go together."
</p>

<p>
Of course we had never heard of such a thing.  In
fact, family worship in any form was one of the
dainties we kept for visitors&mdash;if they were able to
help themselves.
</p>

<p>
So Mr. Laird spoke a few words about their Scottish
Psalmody&mdash;I had never heard the term before&mdash;and
he said there were no hymns to touch them, for
strength and grandeur.  I consider this epoch-making,
in a certain sense; for the psalms of David have
been the songs in the house of my pilgrimage for
long years now.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly uncle asked him to sing one for us.  He
seemed quite willing, and we all listened eagerly;
except Charlie, who thought, I fancied, that it was a
waste of precious time.
</p>

<p>
I love to sit and think again of that wonderful
experience.  Uncle was there, and my Aunt Agnes,
and my precious mother; my promised husband,
too, was of the little company.  I can see again the
look of expectation, surprise, and almost wonder as
the young minister, with serious mien, sang us one of
the psalms of his native land.  He chose the
eighty-ninth&mdash;I know them nearly all by number now.  Our
visitor's voice was not so cultured as some I have
heard, but it was clear and sweet, and his ear was
true,&mdash;and, best of all, his whole soul seemed to be
in the great words as they rose slowly from his lips.
The words are so noble that I must write them out.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Oh! greatly blessed the people are<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joyful sound that know&mdash;<br />
  In brightness of Thy face, oh, Lord,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They ever on shall go.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "They in Thy name shall all the day<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rejoice exceedingly<br />
  And in Thy righteousness shall they<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exalted be on high."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
So ran the mighty song.  But I think we felt the
grandeur of it most when he sang the next two lines:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Because the glory of their strength<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth only stand in Thee,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
which impressed me then, and still impresses me, as
the most majestic union of words I ever heard in any
form of religious song.
</p>

<p>
"That's wonderful!" said my mother as the psalm
was finished.
</p>

<p>
"Beautiful!" contributed my uncle; "sounds like
it ought to be sung by a race of giants."
</p>

<p>
"So it was," said Mr. Laird.  "The martyrs have
sung those words&mdash;hundreds of them.  That psalm
was a favourite with the Covenanters."
</p>

<p>
"The what?" interjected Mr. Giddens.  "The
Covenanters, did you say?  Who were they?"
</p>

<p>
"The Covenanters," replied Mr. Laird.  "And I
consider that's the greatest name ever given to a
band of men."
</p>

<p>
"Were they a religious sect?" asked Charlie.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir&mdash;they were a religious army," answered
Mr. Laird.  "And I've got their blood in my veins.
Some of my ancestors laid down their lives for their
faith&mdash;and this world never saw an aristocracy like to
them."  His cheeks were flushed, his whole face
animated with a wonderful light&mdash;and he looked
really beautiful.  Never shall I forget the expression
on the faces round me; they didn't know what to
make of this so unfamiliar kind of man.
</p>

<p>
But Charlie was not through with the subject yet.
"Well, that kind of thing may have suited them," he
began again, "and there certainly is a kind of
strength about it.  But I don't like it as well as our
church hymns," he continued, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't think you would," replied the minister,
not smiling at all.
</p>

<p>
Then Mr. Laird took the Bible and went on with
worship.  He first read a bit from the Scriptures,
though what part it was I cannot remember.  After
that he prayed.  A beautiful, simple prayer&mdash;I
thought it was so manly, though that's a strange word
to apply to a prayer.  But he never did think, as I
came to know well enough later on, that God cares
to have us abase ourselves just for the sake of doing
so.  Strangely enough, the only one thing I definitely
remember about his prayer is that he said: "Give
us a good night's rest," and it struck me as a
beautifully simple petition.
</p>

<p>
There is one feature of that evening's worship that
lingers with me very vividly.  After we knelt
down&mdash;his chair was a few feet from mine&mdash;Charlie crept
over to the sofa where I was kneeling and bowed
down beside me.  It thrilled me so&mdash;perhaps not in
terms of Charlie Giddens exactly&mdash;but it was the first
time I ever thought of love and prayer going
together.  And I recall how overpoweringly it came to
me that there could, surely, be nothing more sweet
than this, that two who loved each other should pray
together, and should feel that even death could never
separate them, because their love was set in the light
of the Invisible.  Charlie took my hand, too, and I
rather think his eyes were open&mdash;I know his face was
turned to mine&mdash;but I couldn't be sure of this, for my
own were tightly closed.
</p>

<p>
I went outside the door with Charlie after he had
said good-night to all but me; and I do not think the
silent night ever appeared so glorious before.  There
was no moon, but the stars were shining calmly
overhead, and a sweet stillness, fragrant with the breath
of spring, was all about us.  I could hear the twittering
of birds in the magnolia tree, and wondered if
they were the love-lorn pair I had seen taking shelter
there.
</p>

<p>
I fancy I was still thinking of the great words and
the great thoughts of the swelling psalm, but Charlie
seemed to have forgotten all about it.  He evidently
didn't want anything but me.  And his voice was full
of tender passion as he began and pressed his suit
again&mdash;right away, he said, it must be right away.
And he rang the changes a little on the yacht and
Europe&mdash;I wished so much he hadn't mentioned
these, for I felt, in a kind of hungry way, that they
had nothing to do with the real case.  He told me
how much he loved me, and how empty life would be
without me at his side&mdash;but this was in between, and
I felt, away down in my heart, that he wasn't putting
things in their proper places.  But he put his arm
about me, and kissed me, three or four times, I think.
And then he tried again to make me promise&mdash;but I
wouldn't.
</p>

<p>
"When we go abroad, we'll go and see where that
parson used to herd the sheep," he said, and laughed.
"It's a wonder he didn't bring his collie with him,
isn't it?" and I felt my cheeks burn with resentment
at the jest.  But I didn't let him see it&mdash;for I felt I
had no right to resent it.  Besides, he had herded
sheep on the hills&mdash;he said so himself&mdash;and that was
the worst of it.  I thought something like that then,
at least, poor fool.
</p>

<p>
"Let me see its light again," said Charlie, taking
my hand and looking at my engagement ring; "it
makes the whole night radiant, doesn't it?" with
which he kissed it, and held it to my lips that I might
do the same.  I couldn't help glancing proudly at it,
too, for it was a beauty&mdash;and mother said no girl of
our circle had ever had one so valuable.
</p>

<p>
Then Charlie went away and I went back into the
parlour.  They were all there except Mr. Laird.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I took him to the attic myself," said my
Aunt Agnes, "and it was right amusing to see how
he went on over it.  I had told Lyn to light the fire,
and it really looked cozy in the dark when we went
in.  He said it was a room fit for a king&mdash;said he felt
sorry for the elder.  Oh! he was just lovely about it."
</p>

<p>
My mother's mind was engrossed with something
else.  "Wasn't that mortifying at the table," she
began, "about his having been a shepherd, I mean&mdash;he
doesn't understand our way of looking at things
here, or he'd never have mentioned it.  I saw
Mr. Giddens fairly jump in his chair."
</p>

<p>
"I thought it was lovely," I broke in with a
vehemence I could not restrain; "I don't see any
disgrace in that.  I think it's all the more to his
credit."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! no, of course, I don't mean it's any disgrace,"
my mother exclaimed, "but&mdash;it's so funny.
It's so different from anything we've been used to."
</p>

<p>
"You're right there," said my uncle, rising and
moving towards the gas jet, for he was sleepy.
"That's the truth all right&mdash;he's different enough from
what we usually see.  I think he's refreshing, if you
ask me.  But he had better go slow about expressing
his views on these niggers&mdash;if he doesn't want to
get into trouble.  That's one thing sure."
</p>

<p>
"I wish he had told us a little more about his
folks," said my Aunt Agnes, yawning, and winding
up her watch.  "Did you notice he didn't tell us
anything about his father, except that he was a
shepherd&mdash;that he <i>is</i> a shepherd," she revised, "for
he's still living.  I do wonder if he's engaged," she
added, placing the screen in front of the fire as she
spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said I; "certainly he's engaged."
</p>

<p>
"How could you know?" queried my mother instantly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, of course, I don't&mdash;but why shouldn't he be?"
</p>

<p>
No argument could avail against this very easily,
and the matter stood as before.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" my uncle suddenly exclaimed, his hand
upon the chandelier, "I forgot to give him this
letter&mdash;Mr. Furvell gave it to me for him at the church; it
was sent on in care of Dr. Paine.  But he can get it
in the morning," as he deposited it on the mantel.
</p>

<p>
I promptly crossed the room and picked it up.
</p>

<p>
"You inquisitive old maid!" said my mother in mild
reproach.  "Aren't you ashamed of yourself?" as I
stood examining the missive.
</p>

<p>
"I wanted to see what the old country stamp is
like," I answered calmly, my eyes still on the
envelope.  Aunt Agnes was looking over my
shoulder in an instant.
</p>

<p>
"It's a man's handwriting," said she.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" I said, "yes, I reckon it is."
</p>

<p>
"And it's got Virginia spelled with two n's," she
added sorrowfully.
</p>

<p>
"You don't mean to say so!" said my mother,
moving over to join us.
</p>

<p>
"The more the merrier," said my uncle; "and I'm
going to put out the gas, if it had a dozen.  All
aboard for the upper deck."
</p>

<p>
Wherewith we all moved towards the stairs.  "The
last I saw of your Gordon Laird," said my aunt to
me as we went up together, "he was standing with
his face hidden in those roses."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said I, "did you tell him who it was took
them to his room?"
</p>

<p>
"No, never thought of it."
</p>

<p>
"I'm so glad," said I&mdash;with a little sigh.
</p>

<h3>
VIII
<br /><br />
<i>"DEALINGS WITH THE SAMARITANS"</i>
</h3>

<p>
There's something lovely about having a
lovely time.  Now I know that looks like
a very foolish sentence when one reads it
over after having written it down.  So many sentences
are like that; you think they're strong, beautiful,
full of meaning and bright with fancy, while
you're getting them out&mdash;then they appear so pale
and thin when you look them over.  They're like the
fish that you're playing in the water: "What a
whopper," you say, "I've got this time!"&mdash;but how
thin and small when it lies panting on the grass.
</p>

<p>
Yet I venture to repeat, as Mr. Furvell says in his
sermons, I venture to repeat: there's something
lovely about having a lovely time.  In this, I mean,
that it can never be taken away from you.  There
will, you know, be cold, dark days, and bitter
disappointments, and burning tears, and emptiness of
heart, till you quite forget that ever you were glad.
But, even so, all these can never rob you of that one
hour, or day, or month of pleasure unalloyed.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Laird used to say something like this in the
long happy days that followed his arrival.  It had
not been hard to persuade him to prolong his visit.
Fortunately for us, his friend Dr. Paine was engaged
to go, the very next week, to the meeting of the
General Assembly at Dallas; so it was arranged
Mr. Laird should tarry with us till he returned, perhaps
longer&mdash;for I think it was about decided that he was
to take up mission work in Canada.
</p>

<p>
When I say those days were happy, I mean in a
perfectly sane and unfeverish kind of way, of course,
with no thought of&mdash;of what every woman looks for
in every book she reads.  That is, no calm and
courageous thought of it; although I shouldn't wonder
if something of that, more or less diluted, lies back
of all real joy.  Anyhow, Mr. Laird said that very
thing, and more than once, about the unloseableness
of one hour or day of real happiness.  Whatever has
been before of pain, or whatever may be ahead of
sorrow, he said, neither the one nor the other can
ever make pure gladness as if it had never been.  It
belongs to you forever, said the Reverend Gordon
Laird.
</p>

<p>
I should have known that I had no right to be so
happy.  For one thing, Charlie had gone back to
Savannah, and I should have been miserable over
that, if conscience had been half as faithful as it should
have been.  Then, besides, he was waiting for my
decision about Europe and the yacht&mdash;and I had no
claim to happiness till that was settled.  And, most
of all, I wasn't sure about my love for him&mdash;very far
from it&mdash;and so I should have been quite wretched.
</p>

<p>
But I wasn't.  I was shamefully happy.  We were
all happy, I think, to see our visitor so thoroughly
delighted with everything about him.  After all is
said and done, American people take it as a
compliment when old-country folks seem to like them.  I
don't think we ever forget, even the most democratic
of us, that they have dukes and lords across the sea.
And Mr. Laird did seem so perfectly happy.  For
one thing, the weather was delightful, and morning
after morning found him and me&mdash;there was no one
else to act as cicerone&mdash;walking or driving about the
lovely haunts that surrounded our quiet little city.
Everything was in the glory of bud and blossom;
fragrance was wafted on every breeze; the wistaria
and the yellow jasmine were gathered from a
thousand trees.  Sometimes we had picnics too, making
our way on our asthmatic little launch up the
winding river; sometimes we went together to the oyster
market at the wharf, where he seemed to be quite
enchanted with the negroes' singing.  "On the other
side of Jordan," I remember, was a great favourite of
his, and he used to get them to sing it again and
again.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, everything connected with negroes seemed
to have a strange fascination for Mr. Laird.  This
perplexed me considerably, and mortified me not a
little too.  Of course, having spent all my life among
them, they were a commonplace lot to me, and I
regarded them with the kindly disdain which marks
every Southern girl's attitude to the negro race.  But
Mr. Laird seemed to find a new vein in them&mdash;and,
besides, he was so intensely human and so tremendously
interested in all human things.  But he didn't
know how volcanic was the ground he walked on
when he came into contact with the darkies; and
I may as well go aside here to tell how this
provided the only jarring note in all that memorable
visit.
</p>

<p>
One day we were all on the piazza, engaged in that
most delightful occupation of waiting for dinner to
be announced, catching savoury whiffs the while that
betokened its near approach.  All of a sudden a
coal-black negress came through the back gate and
stood at the foot of the porch steps.  Beside her
stood a little curly-headed boy, about three years of
age, clinging to his mother's hand.  She had been
asking for something at the kitchen door, I think&mdash;they
were always asking for something, those darkies.
Of course we simply looked at her; I don't believe
uncle quite did that&mdash;I think he pretended to be
reading a newspaper.  But Mr. Laird, in his impulsive
way, went right down the steps and began talking
to the woman.  It was really aggravating to see
how flattered she seemed to be by his attention.
And then, to our horror&mdash;clergyman as he was and
in full ministerial dress&mdash;Mr. Laird actually took
that pickaninny up, and flung him onto his shoulder,
pretending to be a horse or something of that sort.
And the little negro dug his hands into Mr. Laird's
ruddy locks, while his Anglo-Saxon steed made an
exhibition of himself, galloping once or twice around
the flower bed.  The mother grinned with delight in
a way that I knew fairly maddened uncle.
</p>

<p>
When Mr. Laird finally returned, panting, to his
chair, uncle had quite a time controlling himself to
speak.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know who that child is, sir?" said my
uncle, keeping his voice under fine control.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Mr. Laird, innocent of everything;
"no, I never saw him before&mdash;do you, Mr. Lundy?"
</p>

<p>
Uncle threw his newspaper on the floor without
a word.  Mr. Laird, still all unconscious, meekly
stooped and picked it up.  "I guess I'd better go
and fix my hair before dinner," he said, running his
fingers through the startled thatch.
</p>

<p>
"You'd better wash your hands, sir," said my
uncle sternly, oblivious to muttered appeals from
both Aunt Agnes and my mother; "I'll tell you
who that child is, sir&mdash;it's a coon."
</p>

<p>
"What?" said Mr. Laird, beginning to apprehend.
</p>

<p>
"It's a coon, sir," my uncle repeated, as sternly as
if he had been defining some cub of the jungle; "it's
a nigger coon."
</p>

<p>
"Well?" said Mr. Laird, looking uncle very
steadfastly in the eye.
</p>

<p>
"Well," echoed my uncle, "yes, well."  Then he
paused, but soon gathered fresh strength.  "And I
hardly need to tell you, I presume, sir, that it's not
our custom to fondle darkey babies&mdash;they're supposed
to soil white hands, sir," he declared, waxing
warm.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Laird looked innocently at his own.  "It
hasn't injured mine any, Mr. Lundy," he said simply.
"I don't quite understand what caused the&mdash;the
panic," he concluded, still looking very steadfastly at
uncle.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, sir, I may as well tell you plainly
that such an action as yours would be considered
quite&mdash;quite improper, to say the least.  We don't
take familiarities like that with negro children."
</p>

<p>
"It's a harmless enough looking little chap,"
responded Mr. Laird, nodding towards the receding
youngster.  He was toddling along beside his
mother, his hand in hers.
</p>

<p>
"They're harmless enough while you keep them
in their place, sir," retorted my uncle.  "But you
must know that our people down here have their
own way of doing that.  And you don't understand
the situation, sir, you don't understand the situation,"
repeated Uncle Henry, employing the favourite
formula of the South.  "For instance, I heard you
express surprise at something the other day.  You
remember when Smallwood, the rector of the
Coloured Episcopal Church, called to ask Mrs. Lundy for
a subscription&mdash;you seemed horrified that he went
to the back door, because he was a preacher and
dressed up like a bishop."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Laird nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, if he was the Archbishop of
Canterbury&mdash;or the Pope of Rome&mdash;the back door's the
place for him&mdash;so long as that's the colour of his
skin.  There isn't a self-respecting white family in
the city but would shut the front door in his face.
You understand, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think any more of them for that," was the
quiet retort of Mr. Laird.
</p>

<p>
"That may be, sir.  They'll stand your contempt,
sir&mdash;but they won't let a pack of negroes walk all over
'em," my uncle's gorge rising again.  "And I hope
to God none of our neighbours saw you on the gallop
round our back yard with a negro brat astride of
you.  You'd be finished here, sir, if they did.  Just
before that wench came in here with her young 'un,
I was going to tell you that I met Mr. Furvell, and
he asked me to give you an invitation, for him, to
preach in our church next Sunday.  Well, sir, I hope
it'll stand all right&mdash;but if it got round town that you
made a saddle-horse out of yourself for a nigger whelp
to ride, you'd have the church to yourself, sir; I
reckon a few old women might go to hear you, but
you wouldn't have enough men there to take up the
collection."
</p>

<p>
"I can't do it, Mr. Lundy," said the minister, with
amazing quietness.
</p>

<p>
"Can't do what?" demanded uncle.
</p>

<p>
"Can't preach for your friend," replied the other.
"I'm engaged."
</p>

<p>
"Engaged for what?"
</p>

<p>
"Engaged to preach."
</p>

<p>
"Where?" said uncle, quite forgetful now of the
debate.  I think the same question came in the same
breath from my mother and Aunt Agnes.

<p>
"In the Coloured Methodist Church&mdash;I think they
call it Zion," Mr. Laird informed us calmly.  "I was
there the other day at a funeral&mdash;pretty boisterous
funeral it was, too&mdash;and the preacher got hold of me.
They took up a collection," Mr. Laird laughed, "and
that was how they located me.  I didn't have
anything but a shilling&mdash;a quarter, you call it.  Well, he
invited me to preach for him next Sabbath, and I
agreed.  So I won't be able to oblige Mr. Furvell."
</p>

<p>
"You agreed, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mr. Lundy, I agreed," repeated the stoical
Scotchman.
</p>

<p>
"Good God!" said my Uncle Henry.  My uncle
was not a profane man&mdash;but this was something extra.
</p>

<p>
"Don't get excited, Henry, don't," began my
mother; "Mr. Laird can easily change all that&mdash;he
can get released from his engagement.  He didn't
know we wanted him in our church."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not excited, ma'am," puffed my uncle; "I
was never calmer in my life&mdash;but the thing's preposterous,
madam.  It's utterly absurd&mdash;it's ridiculous."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," broke in my Aunt Agnes, "of course,
it's the easiest thing in the world to arrange.  All
Mr. Laird has to do is to explain to that coloured
preacher that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But I can't," interrupted Mr. Laird; "that is, I
won't."  The word fell strangely on the ears of
Southern ladies.  "I gave him my promise&mdash;and
that's the end of it.  I'll preach in Zion Church&mdash;or
whatever they call it&mdash;next Sabbath morning.  If the
Lord will," he added, with what appeared to us all
quite superfluous piety.  I didn't know then that
Scotch people never take any chances.
</p>

<p>
"But you don't realize what you're doing, sir,"
remonstrated my uncle; "you fail to realize&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'm doing what no man will prevent," broke in
our visitor, and his eye was flashing like the diamond
on my finger; "I'm going to preach the Gospel to
them, if I get the chance."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," began my uncle, "that's all right
in its way, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What's all right in its way?" demanded the
Reverend Gordon Laird, his voice quite resounding now.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right&mdash;that Gospel business," explained
my uncle, evidently a little at a loss.  "The
Gospel's all right in its place, but&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," gave back Mr. Laird, his strong
Scotch lip trembling, "you're very magnanimous, sir."
</p>

<p>
"But you don't know what you're exposing yourself
to," pursued my uncle, apparently deaf to
Mr. Laird's retort.  "They'll make a fool of you in the
pulpit, sir.  I'll tell you something, sir.  Your sermon
will be wasted.  We had a man here once&mdash;a white
man&mdash;an evangelist, who expected to move on
anyhow.  And he tried this little trick of yours&mdash;he
preached to those coons in their own church one day.
And I heard later how they made a fool of him.  He
preached about folks having to use the means.  Good
sermon, too, sir.  But he was no sooner through
than the nigger preacher got up after him&mdash;and he
said he'd give them a little illustration.  Then he told
them a ribald yarn, sir, right in the church; said he
and his ten-year-old brother were in bed once, and
they heard their mother telling their father of some
devilment they'd been up to; and the father said he'd
go up-stairs when he had finished his supper.  Well,
this nigger preacher went on to say he got up to
pray&mdash;but his brother&mdash;his brother believed in using the
means; and so he said he wouldn't pray, but he'd get
up and put something on.  That's what he told
them, sir&mdash;an indecent tale&mdash;and the white preacher
had to sit and hear it," concluded my uncle, his
cheeks burning with indignation.
</p>

<p>
"I won't give the black brother a chance to illustrate,"
said Mr. Laird stolidly; "I'll close the service
when I'm through."  Then he laughed.
</p>

<p>
"You're trifling with me, sir," said my Uncle
Henry chokingly, rising as he spoke.  I saw the
quick pallor come to the cheek of my Aunt Agnes;
as for my mother, she was fairly trembling.  As for
me&mdash;well, I was terrified.
</p>

<p>
But just at this crisis a remarkable thing occurred.
Mr. Laird didn't seem to notice my uncle's
movement at all.  Indeed, he was not looking in his
direction, but sat gazing intently out towards the
road that ran down to the river and the bridge.
Involuntarily my eyes followed his, and a moment
sufficed to reveal the object of his interest.  For
down the road towards us there crept a fragile
figure, swaying unsteadily, overborne with weakness
and her heavy load.  This too was a negro woman,
but cast in finer mould than the stalwart black who
had disappeared from view.  The one who had
just hove in sight, as I could see even at that
distance, was a comely creature, more white than black,
but yet bearing the fatal hue.
</p>

<p>
She was heavy laden, as I have implied.  One
arm bore a great bundle enclosed in a white
sheet&mdash;laundry, doubtless&mdash;while on the other she carried a
plump and complacent infant, crowing as it came,
in that fine oblivion of weight which marks the
procession of the heaviest babies everywhere.  The
young mother was pressing towards the river; a
rusty skiff lay beside the bridge, in which, no doubt,
she was to make her way to the negro settlement
on the farther shore.  She seemed ready to faint
from the fatigue of her double burden, yet she
pressed on with almost rapid steps, as if she must
keep up till she reached the boat.
</p>

<p>
It was this that had attracted the attention of
Mr. Laird, so rapt in observance that he evidently did
not mark my uncle's movements.  For the latter
had hardly risen before our visitor sprang quickly to
his feet&mdash;I can see him now, the tall black-robed
figure, with high brow and auburn hair&mdash;and strode
down swiftly towards the road.  Another moment
brought him alongside of the exhausted negress,
whose white eyes could be seen wearily surveying
him as he approached.  Without a word he seized
both burdens from her arms, the baby held high
aloft as he led the way down to the boat.  The
mother straightened herself and followed closely, as
if she had taken a new lease of life&mdash;it was not all
due to the burdens she had lost, I'm sure&mdash;and the
heavy baby crowed with delight at this improved
style of locomotion.  When, lo&mdash;<i>miserabile dictu!</i>
as I learned in Virgil&mdash;this second pickaninny, with
that tonsorial instinct which seems to mark the race,
plunged its pudgy fingers where those of its
predecessor had held high revel one brief half hour
agone, squealing for very joy as it clutched the
auburn mane of the Reverend Gordon Laird.
</p>

<p>
"Don't that beat the&mdash;the Dutch?" muttered my
Uncle Henry from the porch, gazing at the tall
and supple form, the now laughing and half boyish
face, as our guest strode on towards the river, the
baby and the bale like feathers in his arms.  A
funny smile was on uncle's face, half of contempt,
half of admiration.  "Those two brats both into
his hair!" he murmured to himself&mdash;"and I sure
enough got into his wool," as the grin deepened on
his face.
</p>

<p>
He stood gazing.  Then, recalling his sacred
principles, he broke out anew: "Good heavens,
he's going over to Slabtown with her," for our
undaunted guest had by this time landed the bale in
the bow of the skiff.  Still holding the baby high,
he took the woman's hand and helped her over the
gunwale into the boat.  A moment later we could
see his shirt-sleeves glistening in the sun, he himself
seated in the middle of the skiff, starting to pull
vigorously for the other shore.
</p>

<p>
"Let him go," said my uncle between his teeth;
"he's chosen his company and he can have it.  By
heavens," he went on hotly, "I was never so
insulted in my life.  What the&mdash;the dickens kind of
a man is this Scotchman anyhow?&mdash;I've seen men
shot for less than this.  I remember once in
Texas&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But, Henry," ventured my Aunt Agnes, "you
shouldn't be so hard on him&mdash;he doesn't understand
our&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then why the devil doesn't he keep his mouth
shut?" snorted my uncle; "comin' down here&mdash;like
those infernal Yankees&mdash;an' tryin' to teach us
how to run our niggers.  I've seen men reach for
their hip pockets for less'n that," declared my uncle,
glaring round the circle.
</p>

<p>
"Now, now, Henry," said my mother gently,
"that'll do, Henry.  You're not much of an assassin&mdash;you
know that.  Besides, you can't help admiring
his pluck, can you, now?"
</p>

<p>
"He's too &mdash;&mdash; plucky," muttered Uncle Henry,
gazing at the now distant boat.  Then followed a
season of calm, broken only by the soft voices of
my aunt and mother as they tried to pour oil on the
troubled waters.
</p>

<p>
"And what do you say?  What's your opinion of
your Gordon Laird&mdash;and his nigger friends?" uncle
suddenly demanded, turning on me as stern an eye
as dear old uncle could ever treat me to.  I had not
yet spoken.
</p>

<p>
"Do you want to know?" said I, straightening up.
</p>

<p>
"That's what I asked you for&mdash;what makes you
so white?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  But I think he's glorious&mdash;just
glorious," I said, looking very straight at uncle.
"And I don't care who knows it," I added.  I
believe I stood up as I spoke&mdash;and I could feel my
eyes flashing.  "And you were horrid to him," I
cried, my voice trembling.
</p>

<p>
"Helen," my mother broke in reproachfully, "you
forget yourself, Helen.  And do you know you're
taking up with a stranger, against your uncle?"
</p>

<p>
But the latter didn't seem to hear what my mother
said.  He was staring at me in a way that let me
know the battle was won.  He was a true Southerner,
was uncle, and if anything in the world appealed
to him, it was courage.  Yet he had by no
means surrendered.
</p>

<p>
"Then you can meet him when he comes back,"
he said slowly in a minute, nodding towards the
river; "you can meet him and say good-bye for the
rest of us.  You'll make our farewells to him, you
see.  And tell him the world is wide&mdash;you can
remember that, can't you, Helen?"
</p>

<p>
I smiled up into uncle's face.  "I won't say
good-bye for anybody but Helen Randall," I replied,
speaking just as slowly as he had done, "but I'll do
that&mdash;if I have to.  And I'll tell him&mdash;I'll tell him,"
I repeated, gazing down the sunlit river towards the
sea, "that the world isn't so wide after all."  And I
know not why, but a strange thrill swept over me
from head to foot; for the day was beautiful, and the
fleecy clouds were overhead, and the air was laden
with the sweet breath of flowers, and God's sunlight
was on the river&mdash;and the river flowed on in silence
to the sea.
</p>

<p>
Uncle Henry turned away and presently began a
little pace up and down the piazza.  Fragments of the
storm could still be heard: "Preach the Gospel,
indeed&mdash;act as assistant to a nigger.  A pretty pass,
when our guests turn nurse for darkey coons&mdash;the
attic's too small for him now," as he crossed and
recrossed the porch's sounding floor.
</p>

<p>
Presently he stopped and looked out over the
river.  The rest of us did not need to look&mdash;we had
been watching all the time.  And, away at the end
of the long bridge&mdash;it was one of the longest in the
state, nearly a mile&mdash;we could just descry the moving
figure, all in black again, of our returning guest.
He was coming back afoot, leaving the skiff to its
owners.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Agnes took advantage of a long silence on
uncle's part.  "Well," she said, "I guess I'll order
dinner served; we can't wait any longer."
</p>

<p>
"That's what I say," agreed my mother; "we may
just as well go on&mdash;it'll be better anyhow," she added
significantly.
</p>

<p>
"What?" said my Uncle Henry, turning round
and looking at us.
</p>

<p>
"We were just saying we wouldn't wait dinner
any longer," was the explanation, "and anyhow,
'twould be better to go on&mdash;ourselves.  Considering
everything, you know," and my Aunt Agnes sighed.
</p>

<p>
Uncle stopped still and straightened himself up.
"There'll be no dinner till he comes," he said firmly,
"if it's an hour.  I hope I don't forget what's due to
a guest," as he looked gravely round the circle, "and
especially a stranger in a strange land."  This was
said with the air of a king and a very noble king at
that.
</p>

<p>
"Call Lyn," he said suddenly to me.
</p>

<p>
I did so.  "Where are those niggers anyhow?"
he asked impatiently as he waited for her to appear.
"I reckon they've all been watching the procession,"
jerking his thumb towards the river.  "Oh, here she
is," as the sable attendant pattered onto the porch.
"Lyn, make me a mint-julep&mdash;make it good."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sah!" said the vanishing servant.
</p>

<p>
"Lyn!  Oh, Lyn," he called again in an instant.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sah; heah I is, sah!"
</p>

<p>
"Make two mint-juleps&mdash;and make them both good."
</p>

<h3>

<br /><br />
<i>LOVE'S TUTORSHIP</i>
</h3>

<p>
But those were happy days, as I have said
already.  Neither of us knew, I fancy, whence
came the silent music that was slowly gathering
in our hearts.  But it was there, even though it
came in secret strains, neither recognizing, neither
declaring.  Of course, I was an engaged girl&mdash;and I
was trying to live up to it.  I flaunted Charlie's ring,
sometimes; and I often wrote to him, sitting in the
very same room with Mr. Laird the while, at my
own little desk in the corner.  This itself had been
one of Charlie's Christmas presents.  And I kept
Charlie's letters in the tiny drawer in the top, but I
had so often been careless about it that mother saw
to it herself that it was kept securely locked; I knew
where the key was secreted&mdash;on the ledge above the
library door.  Mother said I really ought to carry it
on a little gold chain around my neck; but I had no
chain&mdash;and I never could bear to have things
concealed about my person.  Mother never glanced at
his letters, of course&mdash;but I sometimes used to show
her bits of mine after I had written them, and mother
would suggest a word here and there, a little tenderer
than the original, and I would stick them in like
plums in a pudding.  Indeed&mdash;I may as well tell
it&mdash;mother rewrote a part of the one in which I kind of
finally renounced any immediate prospect of Europe
and the yacht.  She said no member of our family
had ever been so gifted with the pen as I&mdash;but that
I was a little astray on the facts.  So she fixed my
letter in a way to prevent it being very final&mdash;for she
said if it was ordained that I should go even yet, it
would be wrong to make it impossible.  I fancied at
the time that this was a little like lending
omnipotence a hand&mdash;but mother was an old-time Calvinist,
especially on the subject of me and Charlie, so I
presumed it must be all right to have it as she said.
</p>

<p>
I don't think any of them, and mother least of all,
ever fancied that Mr. Laird had the remotest
connection with my engagement to Charlie.  For he was a
minister&mdash;and that itself would be supposed to settle
it as far as I was concerned.  Besides, he was a
minister without a church, a kind of free lance on a
holiday.  Then, too, we knew he was poor; he never
said so, but there are always certain signs; and he
took great care of his clothes, and seemed very
cautious about money, except when he came across
some one who was very poor.  And I'm sure we all
remembered, though we almost never spoke of it,
that he had been a shepherd, and that his father was
still keeping sheep on the hills of Scotland&mdash;it never
seemed to embarrass him a bit to refer to this, which
we all thought very strange.
</p>

<p>
Then, on the other hand, we hadn't the slightest
reason&mdash;for a long time at least&mdash;to think he cared a
single thing for me.  Indeed, I was just a little
piqued about this; one evening I took some fresh
flowers to his room in the attic, and his diary was
lying open on the table.  I don't know why&mdash;I have
no excuses to make at all&mdash;but my eye fell on the
entry for the first day or two he had been with us.
I only glanced at it&mdash;any girl would, I think&mdash;to see
what he said about us.  And I found references to
uncle, and my mother, and Aunt Agnes&mdash;even to
Lyn and Moses more than once&mdash;but not a single
word about me.  I didn't care a straw&mdash;only I had a
good mind to take the violets down-stairs with me
again.  But I didn't.
</p>

<p>
I have always fancied I would have been a good
deal more interested if I had thought he was
engaged.  But I soon made up my mind he wasn't,
although I had declared so stoutly to the contrary.
For he never seemed to want to be alone, especially
in the twilight&mdash;and that's a sure sign; and he left
all his letters lying around after he had written them;
and when he sang, which he did very nicely, he
preferred "Scots Wha' Ha'e" to "Annie Laurie"; and
he was never melancholy, and never sighed&mdash;and he
never asked the price of things you need for
house-keeping.  So all these signs convinced me
thoroughly.
</p>

<p>
I have already said he didn't seem to care a thing
for me.  And yet&mdash;and yet!  For one thing, he
loved to hear me sing&mdash;and he taught me two or
three of the old psalms that were in a leather-bound
book he brought down-stairs one day.  Then he
seemed so happy when I said I thought them beautiful.
And he talked with me so gently and reasonably
about the darkey question that I finally came to
admit he did right in preaching in that coloured
church.  And I wondered why he cared for what I
thought at all.  Besides all this, he tried to get my
promise that I would take a class in the Sunday-school
after he was gone&mdash;and I remember the gray
kind of feeling I had inside of me when he spoke of
going away.  I wouldn't promise, for I was about as
fit to teach a class as I was to be President of the
United States&mdash;but I promised to help in the library.
</p>

<p>
By and by, though I can't tell how, we even came
to speaking about Charlie.  And he praised him,
said he was such a clever business man, and
handsome.  I didn't think much of that; but one
evening, when we were sitting on the shore all alone,
he said he thought an engagement was such a sacred
thing&mdash;and he urged me, in a veiled kind of way,
always to be true to Charlie.  And it was then I began
to know&mdash;any true girl would know there was
something, when he talked like that.
</p>

<p>
And it was through that&mdash;that kind of conversation,
I mean&mdash;that it all came about.  Because, by
and by, I actually told him all about my misgivings
and my fears.  Of course I did it all loyally
enough&mdash;I always praised Charlie, and always said I knew
we'd likely be so happy because he was, already&mdash;and
I would try to be.  And I told him one day
how Charlie was still urging me to consent that it
should be soon, right away soon&mdash;and any one would
have thought, if they watched his expression, that he
was very concerned for Charlie's interests.  For a
strange paleness came upon his face when he broke a
silence that seemed rather long, I fancy, to both of us.
</p>

<p>
"I think you should," he said, but his voice was
so strange that I wondered where all his strength
had gone to.
</p>

<p>
"What makes you say that?" I replied, and I
don't believe my own voice was quite natural.
</p>

<p>
"Because I think you'd be happier," he answered&mdash;"and
I want you to be happy."  Then, for the
first time, he looked at me, and his wonderful eyes
were filled with a kind of yearning such as I never saw
before.  So different, indeed, from the look in
Charlie's eyes, though nobody surely ever yearned
more earnestly than Charlie.
</p>

<p>
"I'm about as happy now," I answered, "as any
girl could hope to be."
</p>

<p>
He looked at me enquiringly, and I thought the
paleness was deeper than before.
</p>

<p>
"Just like I am, I mean," I hastened to enlarge,
"with a lovely house, and having a lovely time&mdash;and
uncle and aunt and mother all so good to me."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't the same," he said.
</p>

<p>
"The same as what?" I pressed, knowing I should
not.  But I remember yet the thrill of peril and pain
and joy that accompanied the words.
</p>

<p>
"The same as love&mdash;real love," he answered
slowly.  "It isn't the same at all&mdash;the other is a new
life altogether.  That's what makes life holy&mdash;and
beautiful," he said, his voice so low I could scarcely
hear.  "That's the whole of life&mdash;every bit of it," he
added softly.
</p>

<p>
I answered never a word.  And in a moment he
went on.  "Yes, that's my highest wish for you,
Miss Helen&mdash;that you may find a sphere worthy of
you.  For you'll forgive me, won't you, when I say
you haven't found it yet?  You've got a wonderful
nature," he suddenly startled me with, "and you've
got gifts and qualities that can be so useful, so
wonderfully useful&mdash;and they can give you such deep
happiness too," he went earnestly on, "if they only
get a chance&mdash;if you only give them a chance; if
they're developed, I mean.  And nothing will ever
ripen them but&mdash;but that."
</p>

<p>
"But what?" murmured I, who knew right well.
</p>

<p>
"But love," he answered gently.  "No woman's
life ever really ripens except through love.
And&mdash;forgive me again, but I must say it&mdash;you're not
getting the most out of life, living as you are now, Miss
Helen."
</p>

<p>
I looked at him searchingly.  "As I am now?"
I echoed.  "Why, what kind of life do you think
I'm living?"  But even as I spoke the words my own
poor heart provided all the answer.  I felt rising up
within me a conception, not adequate or full, but
quite sufficient at the time, of the hollowness and
barrenness of the poor frivolous life I was living.  And
I knew, oh, so well, how far from the well-spring of
real joy and peace were the glittering streams at
which I had sipped so long.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" I urged, for he had not spoken.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," he began slowly, "I guess you know.
Nobody can have a nature like yours without knowing
when it's not being satisfied.  You have no work&mdash;no
calling, I mean.  And you don't have any
recreation, except only pleasure&mdash;a little party here,
and a picnic there, a card party yonder, and an
afternoon tea somewhere else.  You know what I mean&mdash;all
those things&mdash;and a nature like yours can't live
on confections," he added, smiling.  "That's why I'll
be glad&mdash;when the other happens."
</p>

<p>
"What other?" repeated I, who knew right well
again.
</p>

<p>
"You know," he said; and the great eyes looked
solemnly and wistfully into-mine.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean when I marry Mr. Giddens?" said
I, dwelling on the words, my eyes never taken from
his face.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said; "that's what I mean."  And his
own eyes never flinched, although I could see the
pallor deepen on his face.  And I rejoiced, though I
honestly believe I scarce knew why.
</p>

<p>
"What difference would&mdash;would that make?" I
asked, looking away.
</p>

<p>
"It would fill your life," he answered quietly, "fill
your life to overflowing."
</p>

<p>
"But I wouldn't give up those things even
then&mdash;card-playing and dancing and everything like that.
I've always done those things&mdash;and I love them,
Mr. Laird.  You don't understand me, I'm afraid.
You see, your life has been a very different one
from mine, hasn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Wide as the poles asunder," he answered without
looking at me.  "I never knew any of those things.
Yes, very different," he repeated.  And he smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Your parents are very religious people, I suppose?"
I ventured.
</p>

<p>
"My mother's not living," he said in a hushed
voice.  "She died when I was ten."
</p>

<p>
"And your father?" I asked in a burst of boldness.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said.  We were sitting by the river at
the time, and the sun was setting, and its last rays
bathed the trees with amber light.  His head was
lying on the ground; and the dying sun shed its beauty
on the wavy hair and the wonderfully modulated
face.  Modulated is the fitting word, for various
voices spoke through the different features, yet the
master note was tenderness, always so lovable in a
man when it is joined to strength.
</p>

<p>
"I'd love to be religious," I said suddenly.  "I
believe I would have been, too, if I'd been a man."
</p>

<p>
He smiled.  "Why would you like to be religious?"
he said, picking up a pebble and throwing it far out
into the river.  "You've just said you love those
other things so much."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, I know I did.  But I mean what I say,
just the same.  I admire that sort of people," I
went on enthusiastically; "religious people, you
know.  Really good people&mdash;like you," I broke out
recklessly.  "I knew an awfully religious girl in
Richmond once.  She was naturally good, no struggle
for her at all.  Well, she married a minister,"&mdash;I
laughed as I said it&mdash;"and nearly all her friends pity
her so.  She and her husband live in the country,
and he takes care of his own horse&mdash;he has three
stations.  But I never pitied her," I declared
earnestly; "I think it must be a perfectly lovely
life&mdash;when your heart's in it.  She loves him to
distraction&mdash;and his work too; and she visits the
people, and she teaches in the Sunday-school.  Besides,
she has two children&mdash;and I think he preaches all
his sermons at her on Saturday nights and she fixes
them up.  But then, of course, she's fitted for that
sort of thing&mdash;she can pray out loud," I concluded,
nodding my head towards Mr. Laird as though this
were the acme of all eulogy.
</p>

<p>
"There are better kinds of prayer than that," he
answered, smiling again; "and I'm so glad you don't pity
her," he added, turning his earnest eyes on me again.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" I could not help enquiring.
</p>

<p>
"Because I was afraid you would," he said
meaningly&mdash;"and she doesn't need it.  Where two hearts
are in love with each other and their work&mdash;I
wouldn't ask any higher heaven than that."  Then
he sighed; although, as I have said, he wasn't much
given to sighing.
</p>

<p>
Then came my question.  For days I had been
burning to ask it; yet I marvel that I was ever bold
enough to form the words.
</p>

<p>
"You talk like a specialist on that subject.  Were
you ever in love, Mr. Laird?"  I shot the words out
quickly; otherwise they never would have come.
</p>

<p>
He turned with swift movement and looked at me.
It seemed to me he looked me over from head to
foot, though I knew he wouldn't do anything so rude.
The paleness was all gone now, I noticed, and I
thought his lip trembled a little.  It was a moment
before he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"You've been very kind in giving me your
confidence, haven't you, Miss Helen?" he asked, very
gravely and slowly.
</p>

<p>
I stammered out my answer.  "Forgive me, Mr. Laird,"
I began penitently; "I had no right to say
what I did.  And if I've told you anything
about&mdash;about me and Charlie&mdash;it was only because it
seemed easy to do it&mdash;because I wanted to.  Because
I trusted you," I added, wishing some one would
suddenly appear.
</p>

<p>
But no one did, and Mr. Laird seemed so dreadfully
calm.  I was waiting, intending to say something
more, when he went serenely on.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I can trust you, too," he said; "and it
seems easy to tell you.  And, anyhow, I don't know
why I shouldn't.  Yes, I was in love once, long ago.
And I was engaged to be married," he continued, in
that same tone of reverence with which he always
spoke of matters such as this.  "But it's long ago
now&mdash;it was while I was in my second year in the
university.  And I had to give her up"&mdash;he smiled
as he turned his eyes on mine&mdash;"had to give her up
for another man.  Her father, like mine, was a
shepherd, and she was bright as a sunbeam and as pure as
the dewdrop in the dell&mdash;that's a line from an old
Scotch song," he interjected, smiling rather more
broadly than I thought he should have done in
mid-narrative of a tragedy like that.  "But a fellow came
home from across the sea&mdash;from Australia&mdash;and he
was very rich."
</p>

<p>
"Did she give you up for him?" I asked, indignation
in my voice.
</p>

<p>
"Not exactly," he answered; "but it amounted to
that.  She wrote and asked me to release her; said
she had found she loved him best."
</p>

<p>
"And you gave her up?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," he said, and I thought what a
magnificent man he was; "yes, what else could I do?
Or what else could she do?"
</p>

<p>
"Didn't you hate her?"
</p>

<p>
"No, of course not&mdash;I think she did perfectly
right.  Anything else would have been false to both
of us.  And they got married very soon after&mdash;they
have three bairns now," and I wondered how he could
smile such a happy kind of smile.
</p>

<p>
"And do you think," I said, "do you think any
girl would be justified in changing&mdash;if she found&mdash;if
she found she loved somebody else?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he answered slowly.  "Yes, I think she
would.  But she has no right to find out anything of
the sort&mdash;I would never find it out," he concluded
firmly.
</p>

<p>
"You wouldn't?&mdash;why wouldn't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I shouldn't," he said; "that's why I
wouldn't&mdash;if I loved, I'd love always."
</p>

<p>
"Would you have loved <i>her</i> always?" I asked,
wondering at my rashness.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said after a pause; "yes, if she had
let me.  Do you know, I believe it's getting
chilly&mdash;shall we go home?"
</p>

<p>
To which proposal I gave swift assent&mdash;outwardly,
at least.  And as we walked along I marvelled at the
restraint of the strong man beside me.  I knew, or
felt, rather, that his heart was a molten mass of
fire&mdash;I couldn't have told why, but its burning heat was
just as real to me as anything could be.  I knew it
was aflame; but he was as reserved, and cold, and
strong, and silent as though we had been talking of
something that had nothing to do with human hearts
at all.  I hated myself for the weakness I could not
conceal.  And I fairly loathed that Scotch girl who
married the rich Australian&mdash;and I hoped all her
children had flaming red hair, like I felt sure she had.
</p>

<p>
That same night I was chatting a while with uncle
before he went to bed.
</p>

<p>
"And what is your majesty going to decide about
Savannah&mdash;and the royal yacht&mdash;and Europe?" he
suddenly enquired, after our talk had run a little on a
kindred vein.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going," I declared vehemently; "at least,
not for a long time&mdash;I simply can't."
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't either," he said meaningly, "if I were
you&mdash;you'll be a fool if you do."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" demanded I.
</p>

<p>
"I reckon you know," said uncle; "if you don't, I
won't tell you.  And I don't blame you, honey.  I
think he's a true blue sort of chap&mdash;but he'll have to
revise his views about the niggers."
</p>

<p>
Well, the result of the whole thing was this, that I
spent a good half hour posting my diary that night.
I too had begun a diary by this time&mdash;and I, too,
took good care whose name shouldn't go into it.  And
the outcome of my half hour's pondering was this
brief entry: "Have made up my mind that I can't
marry Charlie&mdash;and I shall never, never marry the
Reverend Gordon Laird."
</p>

<i>THE RIVER LEADING TO THE SEA</i>
</h3>

<p>
If there is one thing a girl loves more than
another, it's being a martyr.  If there is any
such thing as sweet sorrow, that's where it may
be found.  And of all kinds of martyrdom the love
kind is the sweetest.  Now in all this a woman is so
different from a man.  A man enjoys the suffering
that comes with love&mdash;if some one else does the
suffering; but a woman glories in it&mdash;if some one
else does the loving.  And that was pretty much
my case.
</p>

<p>
For I was having lots of love&mdash;from Charlie.  This
was all very well so far as it went; nor can it be
denied that it went a considerable way.  For every
girl prizes a strong man's love, though she return it
never so faintly.  Like some preachers, she highly
esteems a call&mdash;even if she has little or no thought of
accepting it.  But there is nothing, nothing in all the
world, so troublesome as love; unless it utterly
swamps you&mdash;then is the solution simple.  But to
have just enough to marry on, with no surplus for
the years&mdash;that's dreadful.  That is like launching
some mighty ship when the tide is out&mdash;and it must
be awful to hear the keel grating on the sand.
</p>

<p>
Yes, that's where the martydom comes in, to recall
the noble word with which I began the chapter.
And when the Judgment Day shall dawn&mdash;concerning
which I have no doubt, but much misgiving&mdash;the
most oft-repeated charge against our poor
weak womanhood will be that we sold ourselves for
nought.  Some of our loveliest will be the first to
learn, in that great day, how deadly was the barter
of their bodies&mdash;and of so much more.  I have often
heard uncle say that when a horse is sold its halter
always goes along&mdash;but no one ever told me that
when a girl sells her body, that sale includes the
soul.  Reluctant, protesting, even horrified, it yet
must cleave to its tenement of clay and meet the
tenant's doom.  And what a doom! if it be fitting
destiny for those who have bartered the sanctity of
life, some for bread, some for home, some for gold,
some for fame, some for earthly station; and some,
nobler these, for very hungriness of heart, crying out
for the nameless something that shall satisfy the soul.
</p>

<p>
I hardly know just how or when I resigned myself
to such a martyrdom.  But I did.  I decided to
marry Charlie, right soon too&mdash;despite the defiant
vow I had registered in my diary that night.  One
thing I'm sure of&mdash;and that is, that Europe and the
yacht had mighty little to do with it.  But whether it
was because I feared Charlie might throw himself from
the deck of the aforesaid yacht if I didn't marry him;
or whether I felt it was a matter of honour; or whether
I knew it would throw mother's life into eclipse; or
whether I agreed with that semi-intelligent philosopher
who once said that all life was a gamble in
probabilities, or something of that sort, I cannot say.
But anyhow, one midnight hour, I drew my pen
through the first half of that diary vow, the part
which declared I could never marry Charlie, and I
left uninjured the savage promise to myself that I
would never, never marry the Reverend Gordon Laird.
</p>

<p>
Besides, he had been horrid.  Not in any positive
sense, of course, for Mr. Laird was such a perfect
gentleman.  And yet he was a gentleman after a
fashion I had never seen before.  He was not in
the least like our Southern gallants; he couldn't
bow like them, nor make pretty speeches&mdash;and he
wouldn't jump across the floor to pick up my
handkerchief, though I once saw him give Dinah a hand
up the back steps with a heavy block of ice that had
slipped from her grasp and fallen to the bottom.
And he never brought me flowers, or candies, except
some wild violets he might sometimes pluck&mdash;and
once he did give me some molasses taffy, of
which his reverence himself partook with almost
juvenile enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
But he was scrupulously polite, and that's so hard
for a girl to stand if she's interested in a man at all.
And he seemed so strong, and self-possessed, that he
was distant without meaning to be&mdash;the distance of a
sort of superiority, all the worse because you knew
he wasn't trying to make you realize it at all; and I
had the intolerable feeling that his world was an
altogether different one from mine, and that he was
interested in things I didn't know about, yet which
I felt might be just as much mine as his if I only had
a chance.  As it was, however, I was a good deal like
a child standing knee high to some man whose face
was half hidden by the telescope to his eye; if he
knew you were there at all, you felt the very most
he'd do would be to pat your head and ask you if
you'd lost your ball.
</p>

<p>
I don't know what finally decided me.  But anyhow
I wrote Charlie a letter, and told him Yes.  "Yes,
right away," was the burden of what I said, "as soon
as I can get ready."  I thought at the time what a
cruel term that was, "getting ready"&mdash;as if the milliner
and dressmaker had any part to play in that.  All
the world I would have given to have known how to
really "get ready" in my inmost heart and life.  But
I wrote the letter, and sealed it, and kissed it on the
outside&mdash;which I felt was the proper thing to do&mdash;and
then I placed it in the Bible on my dressing-table,
taking quite a pious satisfaction in the fancy.  Then
I sat down and cried till my eyes were sore and the
Bible all stained with bitter tears.  Later on, I told
my mother; her joy was quite enough for two, quite
too much for me.
</p>

<p>
And I told Mr. Laird too.  Some will ask why,
and perhaps make merry over that delicate reserve
which Southern women pride themselves upon.  But
let them ask, and let them make merry as they will.
Besides, I had already told Mr. Laird so much that
it was surely natural enough for me to tell him this.
Moreover, was he not a minister&mdash;and what are they
for if not to be confided in?
</p>

<p>
So I told him I was going to post a letter.  It was
the gathering dusk, for such a letter should never sure
be launched in the garish light of day.  Then I told
him what was in it, or, at least, told him enough to
let him know; for he was remarkably "quick in the
uptake," to adopt a phrase of his own countrymen; I
think I referred, too, to his own counsel in the matter.
</p>

<p>
He didn't speak for a little, nor could I see his face.
But when he did break the silence, it was to say he'd
walk to the post-office with me; he added that the
exercise would do him good, since he hadn't had much
of an appetite for supper&mdash;which was, I thought,
one of the shabbiest speeches he could have framed.
But I let him come.
</p>

<p>
"Why not row down?" he suddenly suggested as
we came to the bend in the road beside the river.
Our boat-house, its door wide open, was at the water's
edge.  "We can land within a square of the office,"
he enlarged.
</p>

<p>
I should have refused, I know; for the letter to
Charlie was in my hand.  But I didn't.  And I
remember yet the sense of sweet helplessness I felt as
he turned and led the way to the boat-house.  It all
comes back to me again.  I stand once more alone,
outside, while the tall form disappeared within the
low-roofed house.  The sound of pushing and rolling
I hear again as the boat emerged slowly from its
home.  The rattle of oars comes back, idly rolling to
and fro in the rocking skiff; the metallic chink as
they were being adjusted in the iron sockets; and the
lapping waves, and the soft breath of evening, and the
distant noises of the drowsy town.  I remember, too,
that there was neither moon nor star, the sky all
veiled with the gentle haze that often marks our
Southern spring.  He rowed; and I sat in the
armchair in the stern.
</p>

<p>
"You're going too far out," I said suddenly, for
we were near the middle of the river.
</p>

<p>
"I want to get a last look at the place," he said,
"and one can see better from out here.  Doesn't the
town look lovely in the dusk?&mdash;see all those
twinkling lights."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I agreed, "it's beautiful.  Why do you say
that?" I asked, trying to conceal the tremor in my
voice.
</p>

<p>
"Say what?"
</p>

<p>
"What you said a moment ago&mdash;about a last
look&mdash;why the last?"
</p>

<p>
"Because it is," he answered slowly, the oars
hardly moving now.  "I'm going away."
</p>

<p>
I looked down at the dimpling track my hand was
making in the water.
</p>

<p>
"When?" I said; oh, so carelessly.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Where?" as I caught at the little throb in my
voice.
</p>

<p>
"To Canada&mdash;they've got an opening for me
there.  I'm going to take a mission field."
</p>

<p>
I made no response.  But I knew for the first
time, in all this life of mine, what it really meant to
have a heart on fire.  He was not looking, so he
could not see the quick rise and fall of my bosom as
I looked out through the deepening darkness towards
the twinkling shore.  I could see the dim outline of a
few tall elms on the bank; and muffled sounds floated
towards us across the darkling water.  But what I
remember most was the wonderful stillness that
reigned without, while the first real heart-storm I had
ever known raged deep within.
</p>

<p>
One hand was in the water, troubling the unconscious
element; in the other I still held the letter
I had written Charlie.  And I leaned far out over
the edge of the boat, withdrawing my gaze from the
shore; but the silent river gave back nothing except
murky blankness.  Life had the selfsame colour to
me then, poor child and changeling that I was.
Suddenly I felt that his eyes were on me, though the
gloom was deepening&mdash;and I trembled, actually
trembled; if I had been alone with him in mid-ocean
I could not have trembled more.  Perhaps I glanced
down the sullen river and remembered that its home
was the far waiting sea.
</p>

<p>
Then he moved&mdash;and towards me.  If there had
been a mile between us, instead of a few paltry feet,
I could not have been more conscious of his coming.
For he never spoke, and I neither spoke nor stirred.
In a moment he was beside me, or at my feet, or
both.  And such a transformation I had never seen.
His voice was low and unsteady, choking almost, and
I could catch the wonderful fire of his eyes as they
were fastened on me in the gloom.
</p>

<p>
"Don't," I said faintly, "please don't&mdash;let us row
in&mdash;we'll miss the mail."
</p>

<p>
But he made no movement, never even glancing at
one of the oars which had been lifted from its socket
and slipped with a little splash into the stream.
The other sulked alone in the darkly dimpling
water.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Helen," he said in an altered voice, such a
voice as I had never heard before, "you know&mdash;you
know all I want to say."
</p>

<p>
He had hold of my hand, the one that held the
letter.  And still I did not move or speak.  But
a swift thought flashed through my mind; it was of
another day, when another man had thus laid siege to
me&mdash;and I knew now what life's real passion meant.
Yes, I will tell it&mdash;and they may smile who will&mdash;my
whole soul leaped in silent ecstasy, and triumph, and
hope.  But the greatest of these was hope.  I knew,
at long last, what it meant to love and to be loved&mdash;and
no queen ever gloried in the hour of her coronation
as I silently rejoiced in mine.  I forgot that he
was stronger than I, and greater, and nobler; forgot
all about the strength of intellect that I had felt as a
gulf between us; all the difference, too, of life's aim
and purpose was sunk and forgotten now.  I even
forgot that he was a minister at all, set apart for life
to duties and sacrifices for which I had neither gift
nor inclination.  I only knew I loved him, and that
we were alone together&mdash;and that he was at my feet.
</p>

<p>
"Helen," he began again, "I'm going away&mdash;and
you'll forget all about me, won't you, Helen?"
</p>

<p>
It was sweet to hear him speak my name.  And
his words would mean, of course, that he wanted me
to forget&mdash;but I knew what they really meant, and I
held every tone sacred to my heart.
</p>

<p>
Then I said, and the words were soft as the breeze
about us: "I won't."
</p>

<p>
I knew it was wrong&mdash;for Charlie's letter was still
in the hand he held.  But it was glorious.  Oh, how
I revelled in the words I spoke!  They were simple
and insignificant, I know,&mdash;but the wild breath of a
new-born love pulsed through them, and I could see
by the kindled face, though the dark was round about
us, how his heart had leaped to recognize their
meaning.  And then his own soul poured itself out in a
great gust of passion, pure and holy and resistless and
triumphant; all the strength and silentness and
self-control that had provoked my wonder through the
days seemed now to be turned to leaping flame as he
told me&mdash;oh, so eloquently and yet so brokenly&mdash;of
such a love as I had never dreamed could be offered
any maiden's heart.
</p>

<p>
"Can you see that steeple there?" he said, his
voice hoarse with feeling as he pointed to the distant
town; "no, it's too dark&mdash;but I can see it.  I see it
even in my dreams.  It was under its shadow I met
you first, when your uncle and I were coming from
the train.  And I knew then, Helen&mdash;in that instant
I knew, and have known ever since, that there was
only one love for me&mdash;and it was you, my darling.
And I knew, I knew, who put the roses in that attic
room of mine&mdash;and they made the place like heaven
to me ever since.  And give me this, Helen&mdash;surrender
it to me," he went on passionately, his fingers
closing stealthily around the letter in my hand.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot," I cried, protesting, summoning what
strength I might.  "Oh, I cannot&mdash;that's my letter
to Charlie."
</p>

<p>
His clasp relaxed a little.  "I know," he said;
"that's why I want it&mdash;and you cannot, you must
not, send it now."
</p>

<p>
"But you told me, you told me more than once,"
I pleaded; "you said how true I ought to be&mdash;you
know you did," and I trembled lest his own counsel
should prevail.
</p>

<p>
He seemed to sink back a little&mdash;and awful silence
reigned a moment.  "But I didn't know," he soon
began, new earnestness in his voice, "I only knew
then that I loved you&mdash;and I could have given you
up, I really could&mdash;but I didn't know then that you
belonged to me&mdash;to me, my darling," his voice rising
to the masterful with the words; "I didn't know
then that God meant you for me, and that that was
why He led my steps across the sea.  I could have
given you up&mdash;I swear I could," he cried almost
fiercely, "if it had meant nothing but a wounded
life for me&mdash;but when it's you&mdash;oh, when it's you,
my darling, when your life would be wounded and
broken too.  For you love me, my own," and his
voice had the tenderest strain that ever filled
woman's heart with rapture; "don't you, Helen?"
he went pleadingly on; "oh, say you do&mdash;or tell me,
tell me, Helen, if you don't."
</p>

<p>
Then the silence of death reigned about us both,
though heaven knows I tried my best to break it,
but could make no sound.  And then, then&mdash;with all
the stealth of love and of a strong man's will&mdash;he
gently drew the letter from my hand, my heart
fluttering till it hurt, and without a word he tore it
up, slowly, noiselessly, almost reverently, into a
hundred pieces, and a moment later they fluttered through
the dark out onto the bosom of the silent river.
</p>

<p>
I was like one in a dream, unspeaking still.
Perhaps I had a great sense of weakness, even of
wrong.  But I do not think so.  I only knew that
life was changed to me in that wonderful hour, and
that I cared nothing for the future, all that it might
bring, all my unfitness for it.  I only knew that I
had found at last what my poor, tired, frivolous heart
had been seeking in alien ways for long.  And I
knew that love's great lie, so desperately cherished,
had retreated before Love's great Reality.  And
when he took me in his arms, so strong, so tight, I
shut my eyes and rested there; and when he kissed
me&mdash;only once&mdash;I prayed, a swift, wonderful prayer.
And I knew at last that love was holy, stainless, and
that God was good.
</p>

<h3>
XI
<br /><br />
<i>A MOTHER CONFESSOR</i>
</h3>

<p>
They were waiting for us when we got
home, wondering a little why we were so
late.  We told them we had been on the
river, and Mr. Laird apologized for the loss of the
oar; I remember uncle said it was lucky he was able
to paddle his own canoe.
</p>

<p>
I went into mother's room when I went up-stairs
to fix my hair&mdash;and she noticed that Charlie's ring
was absent from my hand.  I expected her to, for it
was a source of constant joy to her.  Then I told her.
I shall not describe the gust that followed, except to
say that what I remember best about it was mother's
appeal to my sense of unfitness for the life of a
minister's wife.  There was a lot more&mdash;Europe and
the yacht were not forgotten&mdash;about the folly of
giving myself to a life of obscurity and poverty when
a very different one was open to me.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sick of money," I said foolishly; "I've
always had nearly everything I wanted&mdash;and I wasn't
happy."
</p>

<p>
"You'll know the difference when you don't have
your uncle to give you everything you want," said
my mother.
</p>

<p>
"He's been the kindest man that ever was," I
agreed, "but no uncle that ever lived could give a
girl everything she wants.  There's only one can do
that," I went on, for my heart was singing&mdash;"and
I've found him at last."
</p>

<p>
It was then that mother appealed to me on the
ground of my unfitness for the life I had chosen.
And I must admit that <i>did</i> hit me pretty hard.
</p>

<p>
"Look at our minister's wife," she said; "she's
meant for it.  It's true she looks half starved, and
she's always dowdy, and has to make a dress do for
years&mdash;but she's happy in that kind of life."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe I'll be happy too," I ventured to predict.
</p>

<p>
"How could you be?" retorted my mother.
"How could you ever hope to be, when you're not
fitted for that kind of work?  Mrs. Furvell can lead
in prayer."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I can't," I said&mdash;"but I can follow.  And
Mr. Laird says that's better."
</p>

<p>
"And she can take the chair at meetings&mdash;and she
knows how to talk to ministers when they come&mdash;and
they say she looks over her husband's sermons,
and makes suggestions."
</p>

<p>
"My husband's sermons won't need any," I made
reply.  And at this I blushed furiously: the word
sounded like a beautiful judgment day.  I knew how
crimson my face and neck all grew, for I was standing
in front of a pier glass at the time, my hair flowing
down about my shoulders.  And I wondered if I was
beautiful&mdash;I hoped I was, but not for my own sake
at all&mdash;I can honestly say no vanity was in my
thought.  Everything was different now.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," conceded my mother, "I believe in a
girl marrying for love&mdash;but you haven't known him
long enough.  Now Charlie's different; you've known
him so long."
</p>

<p>
"That's just where it comes in," said I, dimly
groping for what I felt was a great point.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" said mother.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," I answered, which was gloriously
true.
</p>

<p>
"Besides," digressed my mother, leaving this
obscure point unsettled, "what reason have you got
to think you'll ever get along agreeably with his
folks?"
</p>

<p>
"I'd get along with Choctaw Indians," quoth I,
"if it would make him any happier; besides, I won't
have to&mdash;they're all in Scotland."
</p>

<p>
"Whose happiness do you mean?" enquired my
mother, though she knew right well.
</p>

<p>
"Why, his&mdash;Mr. Laird's, of course."
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to call him Mr. Laird?" pursued
my mother, for womanly curiosity will show itself
even amid high tragedy.
</p>

<p>
"I reckon so&mdash;I don't know," and I laughed as I
spoke; "that never occurred to me."
</p>

<p>
"He didn't ask you to&mdash;to call him Gordon?"
</p>

<p>
"Mercy, no&mdash;why should he?" I exclaimed aghast.
</p>

<p>
"Why shouldn't he?" replied my mother.  "I
remember the night your father asked me to marry
him&mdash;but then, there's no use of that; that's all over
now.  When is he going to speak to me about it,
Helen?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, mother," I said, putting my arms about her
neck, "you're such a woman!  I know you're just
counting the minutes till you'll be alone with him
when he's pleading with you to give your daughter to
him.  That's the next best thing to getting a
proposal yourself, isn't it, mother?"
</p>

<p>
But she was not yet ready for surrender.  "It's
very easy for you, Helen," she said seriously, "to
treat it all as a trifling matter&mdash;but you don't know
what a heavy heart you've given me.  And there's
another thing," she went on, a little timidly, I
thought: "I suppose you don't forget that his
father's a shepherd&mdash;a man that takes care of sheep,
on the hills?" she enlarged.
</p>

<p>
"No, I haven't forgotten it," I answered, and I felt
my colour rising, "nor has he forgotten.  And I
wouldn't care if his father were a chimney-sweep.
Do you mean that, mother?" I demanded, my voice
about as stern as she had ever heard it.
</p>

<p>
"Mean what, Helen?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean that that&mdash;about his father being a
shepherd&mdash;should make any difference to me?  When
I love him?" I added, my voice shaking a little.
</p>

<p>
"No, child, no.  No, of course not," my mother
hastened to reply; "only it'll be a little awkward,
I'm afraid.  You've got to consider everything, you
know."
</p>

<p>
"That's just what I'm doing," I retorted quickly.
"And if he's good, and true, and noble&mdash;and he
is&mdash;what difference does it make to me who his father
is, or what he does?  It won't be as awkward as to
be married to a man you don't love&mdash;that's what I
<i>would</i> call awkward," I cried, "and that's what nearly
happened me.  And he&mdash;Mr. Laird&mdash;he tore the
letter up and threw it into the river, thank God!" as
the tears that could no longer be restrained poured
forth at last.
</p>

<p>
Her tender arms tightened about me as she soothed
me with some explanation of what she meant, telling
me meantime that I was tired and needing rest.
Nor did the interview last much longer, being fruitful
of but little satisfaction on either side.  Mother
loved me too well to make any real unpleasantness
about it; and, before we finished, she laid most of her
grief to the score of Charlie's broken heart.  But she
did add, rather sorrowfully, that in all probability
now I would live and die without ever seeing Europe.
</p>

<p>
I believe there's no place where a girl so feels
the trembling joy of love as in her own little room
when first she returns to it with her lips still moist
from the sacramental kiss.  I have often wondered
since why this is so.  And I do not know.  But I
remember well, with quickening heart, that almost
bridal hour.  I did not light the gas&mdash;and I
wondered at the time why I shrank from doing so&mdash;but
kindled instead the candle on my dressing-table.
The soft and tender light accorded better with my
mood, and the flitting shadows that fell across the
room seemed beautiful.  When I was undressed and
robed for the night, I sat long, my hair still flowing
on my shoulders, before the pier glass, gazing into
my own eyes for very joy.  The shallow will say it
was empty vanity; but it was not.  It was a kind
of communion time, searching, so far as I could,
the mystic depths of a personality that had been so
suddenly wakened to a new and holy life.
</p>

<p>
I know not how long I lingered thus, peering
into the hidden future&mdash;once or twice I buried my
hot face in my hands&mdash;marvelling at the ministry
of love, before I put the candle out and went to
bed.  And then, strangely enough, there stole into
my mind the verse Charlie used to love to hear me
sing.  I hummed it softly to myself:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Still must you call me tender names<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still gently stroke my tresses;<br />
  Still shall my happy answering heart<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep time to your caresses."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
But now the words seemed all on fire and I
wondered why their beauty had never appeared to
me before.  I lilted them again and again, the image
of my lover, my first real lover, before me all the
time&mdash;and I wondered when, if ever, I would sing
the words for him.
</p>

<p>
But all of a sudden I felt that this was frivolous.
For it was beginning to be borne in upon me&mdash;scarcely
thought of in the first rush of joy&mdash;what
manner of man this was whose lot I was to share.  I
was to be a minister's wife!  With a wave of
cowardice I hid my face under the snowy covers as
I thought of it; while visions of other days, of
dances and parties and cards, and all sorts of alien
things, floated before my eyes.  I fought against
them all with an intensity they did not deserve,
really trying to lead my thoughts into higher
channels.  And there came into my mind&mdash;which I
have always considered an intervention from a Higher
Source&mdash;a line or two of a psalm I had heard
Mr. Laird sing more than once.  The words came back
to me so readily, and I said them over and over
again to myself:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I to the hills will lift mine eyes<br />
  From whence doth come mine aid,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and, almost before I knew it, I had slipped out of
bed and was on my knees in prayer.  I must confess
that I barely knew how to pray&mdash;that is, outside of
a little groove along which my devotions had tripped
since I was a child.  But this time I really did
pray&mdash;out of my own heart&mdash;though I fear it was a very
broken and halting prayer, a poor sort of thing
compared to those finished efforts of Mrs. Furvell to
which my mother had referred.  Yet I think it was
sincere.  I asked God to guard my love&mdash;but
especially his&mdash;and to not let anything happen to
spoil it; and to help me give up everything that
was wrong or frivolous, and to make me some help
to him in his life-work.
</p>

<p>
I was hardly snuggled up in bed again before I
heard Mr. Laird coming up-stairs to the attic.  I
suppose he had been doing some thinking on his
own account, all alone in the parlour.  His room was
right over mine&mdash;and that was why I had such a
luxurious night.  For very soon he began walking
up and down the floor&mdash;I don't think he knew I was
just beneath&mdash;and he kept up that lonely tramp for
hours.  Every step he took was music to me.  Back
and forward, forward and back, he walked, and I
could fairly see the tall, noble form, the serious face,
the deep, penetrating eyes.  Once or twice he
stopped, for a few minutes; and I began to fear he
didn't love me as he should.  But soon the firm
tread began again and then I knew how really dear
I was.
</p>

<p>
Dozens of times since then, when I have teased
him about it, he has told me those little silences
came when he threw himself on his bed and snatched
a few minutes' sleep; but that he knew I was
listening, so he would shake himself, dash some cold
water on his face or wrap a towel about his head,
and start on his beat again.  But I knew better&mdash;and
anyhow, he confessed to me once that nothing
short of chloroform could have kept him still that
night.
</p>

<p>
When we assembled at breakfast the next morning
Mr. Laird didn't eat anything except one little
half slice of toast&mdash;and I could see how this appealed
to mother, though she maintained a sad gravity
throughout.
</p>

<p>
When the meal was finished he asked mother
if he might have a few minutes with her alone.
And she asked him what could it possibly be
about!

<br /><br />
<i>THE WAIL OF THE LOWLY</i>
</h3>

<p>
It was "Gordon" now, always "Gordon"&mdash;though
of course nobody called him that but
me.  For he had made yet another little addition
to his visit&mdash;and he and I had improved the
time.  But his departure was near at hand.
</p>

<p>
And it does seem sad that what occurred had to
happen just before he left.  For everything had gone
so beautifully.  Mother, it is true, used to sigh
sometimes, and once or twice expressed the hope that
Charlie hadn't killed himself when he got the tidings
and the ring.  I had no such fears; for the brief note
that came back informed me that he would say nothing
till he came and saw me; which, he said, he would
do as soon as some very urgent business would
permit.  But mother declared she knew this was only
said to conceal the fact that he was prostrate in his
bed.
</p>

<p>
I believe Aunt Agnes and Uncle Henry were quite
composed about the whole affair&mdash;they thought so
much of Gordon.  And even mother was getting fond
of him; she couldn't very well have helped it, he was
so strong and tender and dignified and true.  And I
can't tell how happy it made me to see mother
warming up to him; a few days before he intended to go
away&mdash;and the very day of the explosion I am about
to describe&mdash;I saw mother pull his hair.  Just a little
tug, it's true, a little playful pinch of a few of the
auburn strands&mdash;but it filled my soul with joy, for I
think it means more for certain kinds of women to
give the hair a little pull like that than if they took
the whole man into their arms.  So I pretended not
to see, lest my Gordon's hair should never be pulled
again.
</p>

<p>
We were all pretty resigned, as I have said&mdash;especially
Gordon and myself.  And if Gordon had only
gotten away to his Canadian field before that
eventful night&mdash;or if every negro in the South had only
died or been deported the day before&mdash;the whole
tenor of our after lives might have been changed.
</p>

<p>
We were seated on the porch, uncle and Gordon
and I.  My mood, I fear, was a rather plaintive one,
for I didn't know when my lover would be coming
back.  Uncle, however, seemed in a very jovial frame
of mind; but the worst storms always come on the
most placid evenings.  He had just been telling
Gordon that he thought I would make a pretty fair
minister's wife after all.
</p>

<p>
"You know, Mr. Laird," he remarked in mock
seriousness, "there's one feature of Helen's record
that makes me think she's right religious after all."
</p>

<p>
"Let us have the symptoms," said Gordon, and he
couldn't have looked at me more tenderly if he hadn't
had a drop of Scotch blood in his whole make-up.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's this," drawled my uncle; "I've never
known Helen to miss a Sunday-school picnic since
she was able to toddle&mdash;she'd go without her lessons
before she'd miss one.  Now don't you think
that's a good sign?" and uncle indulged himself in
the merriment his little joke deserved.
</p>

<p>
Gordon made some laughing response, I have forgotten
what.  And it was then that uncle began the
fatal strain.  It really seemed as if it had to be; for,
ever since that other darkey outbreak, both men had
been careful to steer clear of the dangerous topic.
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to look out," uncle began, "that
those folks up North don't tramp on your wife's
Southern corns."  Gordon gave me a funny look&mdash;whether
it referred to the sublime word, or the grotesque
one, I couldn't tell.  "For instance," uncle
went on, "the first thing you know, some of them'll
be expressing their opinion about slavery and airing
their views on the whole question of the darkies.
Now I want you to protect her from that&mdash;don't let
them bring the subject up if you can help it.  And,
just as like as not, they'll be flaunting that Uncle Tom's
Cabin nigger show under your noses.  There was a
company brought it down here once&mdash;but we read
the riot act to them.  It was 'Katy, bar the
door' for them.  Some of them just got off with
their necks.  And I want you to promise me, Helen,
that you'll never look at their infernal show; they
say it's all whips, and handcuffs, and bloodhounds,
and all the rest of the lies that Harriet Beecher Stowe
concocted.  You'll promise me, won't you, Helen?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't trouble yourself about that, uncle," I
answered evasively, being always a cautious maiden
along certain lines; "most likely Mr. Laird doesn't
know what you're talking about.  Do you, Gordon?"
I enquired, the change of name very sweet.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," he promptly replied.  "Yes, I've read
the book&mdash;read it on the heathery hills, when I was
quite a wee laddie."
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever read such a parcel of lies, sir?"
demanded my uncle, fully expecting that there could
be only one answer.
</p>

<p>
"I'm really not in a position to give an opinion,"
Gordon replied judiciously; "you see, I never saw
slavery."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I have," uncle responded vigorously, "and
the book's a bunch of lies.  Of course, I suppose some
brutes might mistreat their niggers.  But it wasn't
natural, sir&mdash;it wasn't to their interest to do so&mdash;a
man wouldn't do it with his horse.  And the niggers
were enough sight happier then than they are now&mdash;they
were perfectly contented, sir."
</p>

<p>
"That's the worst of it," said Gordon tersely.
</p>

<p>
"What say, sir?  I don't know that I understand you."
</p>

<p>
"That was the saddest feature of it&mdash;that they were
contented," repeated Gordon calmly; "that's what
slavery did for them.  But it seems to me, Mr. Lundy,"
he went on, warming a little to the argument,
"it seems to me the book in question doesn't deny
that most of the negroes were well used."
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't?" uncle began in a rather fiery tone;
"it doesn't, doesn't it?  It's the most one-sided
book that was ever written&mdash;has niggers dying
under the lash, and hunted with hounds, and all that
sort of thing.  What's that, if it isn't one-sided,
sir?"
</p>

<p>
"As far as I remember, 'Uncle Tom's Cabin'
impressed me as decidedly fair, quite impartial,"
Gordon ventured, his voice very calm.
</p>

<p>
"It's a pack of Yankee lies, sir," interrupted my
uncle warmly.
</p>

<p>
Gordon flushed a little.  "That's hardly argument,
Mr. Lundy," he replied slowly.  "You remind me
of what Burke said of Samuel Johnson&mdash;he said
Johnson's style of argument reminded him of a
highwayman; if his pistol missed fire, he knocked
you down with the butt end of it."
</p>

<p>
"What's that got to do with niggers?" enquired
my uncle blankly.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing&mdash;just with the argument," answered
Gordon.  "I said I thought 'Uncle Tom's Cabin'
impressed me as impartial&mdash;and you retorted it was
Yankee lies.  That's like calling Euclid a liar
because you dissent from his proposition, as your great
Lincoln said."
</p>

<p>
"He wasn't ours&mdash;and he isn't great," retorted
uncle vigorously.
</p>

<p>
"Half of that may be true," Gordon answered in
the most amiable tone.  "But about the book&mdash;I'll
state my position.  Mrs. Stowe portrays three men,
if I remember right, who had to do with slaves.
Shelby, St. Clair, Legree, were the names, I think.
Well, one of them, Legree, is depicted as a brute&mdash;but
the other two were like fathers to their slaves.
Now, if that isn't fair&mdash;two to one&mdash;I don't know
what is," concluded Gordon placidly, "especially as
you've just admitted yourself that the brutal type
was always to be found, even if the exception."
</p>

<p>
I was growing nervous by this time, and with
abundant cause.  It was with a sense of hearty
relief I heard Aunt Agnes hurrying towards the
porch; and before the argument could further go,
she blew in upon the scene with tidings of an
invitation she had just received for me and Gordon for
that very evening.  I wasn't slow to make the
most of the digression, and soon the ship of domestic
peace was clear of the threatening rocks.
</p>

<p>
Yet I could see, all through the early evening,
that the debate had left its impress upon Gordon.
It was really wonderful how a question of this kind
took hold of him; anything human, especially if
connected with sorrow or injustice, seemed to kindle
him as nothing else could do.  More than once he
harked back to it within the next hour or two when
he and I were alone.  "It's beyond my understanding,"
he broke out, "how any man&mdash;especially a
Christian gentleman like your uncle&mdash;can defend an
institution that made one man a slave of another."
</p>

<p>
"But they were good to them," I defended.
</p>

<p>
"Yet they were in bondage," was his terse reply;
"and besides, Helen, you know they often had to
sell them&mdash;even when they didn't want to.  I've
talked to coloured women on the streets here,
who told me their children were sold away from
them long years ago&mdash;and they've never seen them
since.  And they cried," he added, his voice taking
what was almost a shrill note, plaintive with
sympathy.  "And I don't care if they did keep their
slaves in luxury&mdash;-if they had clothed them in purple
and fine linen and fanned them all day long&mdash;any
institution that makes it possible for a child to be
sold from his mother, it's&mdash;it's damnable," he
declared passionately, "and neither God nor man
could convince me to the contrary."
</p>

<p>
I was almost frightened at Gordon's vehemence&mdash;and
I was powerless before his argument.  A kind of
chill foreboding had me in its grip, I knew not why,
that his strange intensity on this so fiery theme was
yet to work us ill.  For, like other strangers, he had
no conception of how deep, almost desperately deep,
were the convictions of Southern men on the subject
that seemed so thoroughly to engross him.  He
harboured the romantic notion that all men were
created equal, as the framers of our Constitution
solemnly decreed, their slaves cringing at their feet the
while.  He held the quixotic view, too, that it was
wrong to cheat the darkies out of their votes&mdash;I always
thought he was astray on this point, and I think so
yet.  Gordon contended, also, that they had the same
kind of feelings as white folks&mdash;but I suppose that
will be a debated point while time shall last.  Gordon
did not know, however, how necessary it was that the
darkies should be kept in their proper place; nor did
he know the long purgatory our Southland had gone
through in the days of reconstruction, and carpetbaggers,
and negro rule, and all that sort of thing.  He
had no idea of the fiery zeal with which white men
had to guard their supremacy, enforcing the social
distinction, keeping the negro where he belonged,
piously preserving the curse of Ham upon him.  In a
word, Gordon hadn't grasped this fundamental truth&mdash;which
the world may just as well accept first as last&mdash;that,
no matter how the negro race may predominate
in numbers, or grow in wealth, or develop in intelligence,
the white man never will be ruled by the black
man.  And the only way to prevent his being on top
is to keep him at the bottom.  So I have heard ten
thousand times&mdash;and so I heartily believe.
</p>

<p>
I think Gordon and I were discussing this very
matter that night as we were walking home from the
little gathering of which I have made mention already.
Coming along the street that skirts the river, my
attention was suddenly attracted by the sound of voices
from near the water's edge, negro voices evidently,
and marked by tokens of excitement.  I at once
stopped and called Gordon's attention to it.
</p>

<p>
"They're darkies," I whispered; "what can they
be doing there at this hour of the night?"  For it was
midnight.  "And that's uncle's property," which was
true enough, he being the possessor of a shed and
warehouse there that stood on the river's bank.
</p>

<p>
"What indeed?" Gordon echoed.  "You don't
suspect anything wrong, do you?"
</p>

<p>
I made some incoherent reply, muttering something
about fire, I think.  For that is a constant form
of dread to the Southern mind.
</p>

<p>
"I'll go over and see," said Gordon.  "You come
part of the way&mdash;wait there, I won't let you out of my
sight," as he moved on towards the shadowy figures
that could be seen moving in the darkness.  A low
mysterious wail broke from them at frequent intervals.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing here?" I heard Gordon's
stern Scotch voice ring out a moment after he had
left me.  A sharp cry of fear broke from the two
crouching forms as they turned their dusky faces up
to his through the night.  They were two negro
women and their rolling eyes shone white in the
darkness.  They stood before him trembling.
</p>

<p>
"Come, speak; what are you doing here?" Gordon's
voice came sterner than before.
</p>

<p>
"Please, sah, we's lookin' fo' our chil'uns," one
liquid voice wailed forth.
</p>

<p>
I was Southern born and Southern bred&mdash;and I had
been taught, as carefully as any, the non-humanity of
the black.  Yet I do not know that I ever felt such a
gush of inward tears as rushed upon my heart that
moment.  The scene is before me yet; the stalwart
frame in clerical attire, towering above the cowed and
obeisant figures of the stooping women who seemed
to crave, rather than expect, some word of human
sympathy, some hand of human help.  Poor, despised,
ignorant, their cry yet echoed with the great note of
love, the throb of primal passion pulsing through it;
the age-old cry of the mother calling for her child.
And I felt a wave of pity surging over me, such as I
had never felt before.  I rushed forward to where they
stood; for the time, at least, we belonged to the
self-same race&mdash;mine, too, was a woman's heart.
</p>

<p>
Their story was soon told, for it was brief.  The
two children, a son of each, had been out playing
together in the early evening.  The last they could
learn of them was to the effect that a negro man,
named Simkins, had been seen talking to them.
Simkins was a drunken loafer.  The unhappy women had
themselves discovered that a little skiff, in which
Simkins had a part interest, was missing from its place&mdash;and
the tracks of boyish feet in the sand could be seen
where the bow of the boat had been.  Doubtless
Simkins had beguiled them with the prospect of a
cruise&mdash;and what then?
</p>

<p>
In a moment Gordon was questioning them with
eager interest, interpreting their replies with difficulty;
for their dialect, unfamiliar to him at the best, was
now more unintelligible by reason of their grief.  While
he spoke with them the women instinctively drew
closer, as if confident of a friend.
</p>

<p>
"Where do you suppose he rowed them to?" he
asked quickly.
</p>

<p>
The women didn't know.
</p>

<p>
"Where does this man Simkins live?" he asked,
after some further questioning.
</p>

<p>
"'Way down by Pickett's Landin'&mdash;by de long
wauf," one of the women said.  "But he done started
from heah, sah."
</p>

<p>
"The long wharf," repeated Gordon, turning to
me, "where is that wharf?  For that's where he'd
try to land, likely enough&mdash;and if anything's
happened, that's where it likely occurred."
</p>

<p>
"I know the place," I answered, "but it's about a
mile away."
</p>

<p>
"We'll search this place first," he said decisively,
"and if we find no sign we'll look there.  Have you
any idea where we could get a lantern?"
</p>

<p>
I thought there might possibly be one in uncle's
warehouse.  A minute later Gordon was inside,
having found an unlocked window.  Two or three
matches flared and spluttered; then a steady light,
and in a moment he had reappeared with the
lantern.
</p>

<p>
Up and down he strode, examining all the
locality, the moaning women following at his heels.
</p>

<p>
"There isn't a sign of anything here," he
announced as he jumped down from a little landing
from which he had been flashing his lantern on the
water.  "I've got a feeling, somehow, that this man
Simkins would try to land at the wharf nearest his
home.  Come away&mdash;we'll go there."
</p>

<p>
"But you'll have to take me home first," I interposed.
</p>

<p>
"Is it on the way?" Gordon paused long enough
to ask.
</p>

<p>
"No, it's the opposite direction."
</p>

<p>
"Then it can't be done," he answered, in a tone
no Southern woman is accustomed to hear; "you'll
have to come with us," and with a word or two more
which I have forgotten, but whose tone of mastery
I remember well, he asked the women which road
to take.  If his manner had been less noble and
self-forgetful I would have said he was lacking in the
chivalric deference I was accustomed to receive at
the hands of gentlemen.  But this never seemed to
enter Gordon's mind, surrendered as it was to the
business in hand.  Before I knew it he was off, and
I had no option but to follow.
</p>

<p>
A strange procession we must have made as we
wound our way through the silent streets.  In front
marched Gordon, the lantern swinging to his stride,
pausing now and then to enquire about a turn in
the way; behind him shuffled the crooning women,
gratitude and woe mingling in their constant
moan; last of all came I, keeping up as best I
could.
</p>

<p>
As we moved out on the rickety wharf, to which
we came at last, I heard Gordon utter an
exclamation of some sort and rush forward.  Then he
stopped, holding the lantern low; its beams
revealed the face of a negro man, lying in drunken
oblivion on the wharf.  With shrill intonation,
rudely shaking him, the women demanded of the
unconscious Simkins the whereabouts of their
children.  But Simkins' only response was a
temporarily half-opened eye, immediately reclosed,
and a groan of drunken content as he sank deeper
into his bestial slumber.  An empty bottle lay
beside him.
</p>

<p>
Gordon turned from him with a murmur of
contempt, bidding the women cease from their
pitiful pleading with the unconscious man.  Swinging
the lantern high, its farthest beams just disclosed
a little skiff floating idly near the shore.  "He's
upset it climbing out, as sure as death," I heard
him mutter&mdash;"it has shot out from under him."  Then
like a flash he made his way over the side,
creeping stealthily down the unsteady timbers till
he was at the water's edge, the lantern still in his
hand.
</p>

<p>
A cry of horror broke from his lips, echoed in
unreasoning woe from the women above him.  He was
peering down into the water.
</p>

<p>
"They're there&mdash;in each others' arms," broke
from him a moment later in a tone of ineffable
sadness.  "Come down and hold the lantern,
Helen."  He reached up his hand to me without
a word; and, to the accompaniment of sounds of
anguish strangely and suddenly subdued, I
clambered down till I stood on the broad beam beside
him.  Still the strange, low chant went on above
us, still the silent stars looked down.  Slowly,
resolutely, still gazing into the placid depths,
Gordon removed his coat and vest while I held
the lantern as he directed.  But I kept my eyes
upward to the stars.  A swift plunge, a half minute's
silence, and he reappeared, one of the hapless
playmates in his hand.  A second pilgrimage into
the depths, and both were side by side upon the
beam on which we stood.  One by one, he bore
them, climbing, and laid them together on the
wharf.  With loud outcry of anguish the women
flung themselves upon their unresponsive dead.
</p>

<p>
They lay together, those little offshoots of an
unhappy race, their own life tragedy past and done.
Dripping they lay, the peace of death upon their
faces, as though the relentless wave had given them
kindly welcome.  About eight or nine years of age,
poor, ragged, despised, they had yet been seeking
some scant share of pleasure&mdash;out to play&mdash;when
death claimed them for his own.  It was the birthday
of one of them&mdash;so his mother said, while each wailed
above her own&mdash;and that was why they had been
permitted to play late.  Each had her simple tale
of love, of admiration; each told, with alternating
gusts of grief, of the goodness of her own.  Each
spoke of the brothers and sisters at home; each
wondered what life would be without the one who
was gone.
</p>

<p>
I stood, helpless.  But I saw, and for the first time,
that God had called Gordon to be a pastor.  For he
knelt beside them&mdash;I think sometimes his dripping
white-clad arm rested gently on the shoulder of one
or the other&mdash;and he tried to comfort them.  He
spoke, so low and tenderly that sometimes I could
scarcely hear his voice, of many things; most of
which I have forgotten.  But I do remember that he
said God didn't love them any less than they; and I
recall yet how wonderfully he spoke of Everlasting
Life.  Those very words, and he couldn't have said
them more grandly if it had been a Cathedral service.
And I think he helped them a little, for they sometimes
lifted their heads and looked at him in a dumb,
grateful way.  But their hearts were broken.  It
came over me strangely that this was the first time I
had ever stood so close to death, and to sorrow&mdash;and
these mourners were of the dusky race.
</p>

<p>
There was little more that we could do.  Of course,
Gordon roused somebody and sent for the proper
persons.  But finally we had to leave them alone, the
women and their dead.  Silently, as if he were
revolving some thought in which I had no share,
Gordon walked home beside me.  Only one thing I can
remember that he said.  I think he stood still and
looked at me through the dark as he said it:
</p>

<p>
"Helen, the Bible says that God made of one blood
all the nations of the earth, doesn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I agreed, wondering what was coming.
</p>

<p>
"They don't believe it down here, do they?&mdash;the
white folks, I mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Maybe not," I answered hesitatingly; "at least, I
reckon they don't think it's meant to be taken literally."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps not," and his eyes glowed like fire and
his voice cut like steel; "perhaps not&mdash;but He's
made of one blood all the mothers of the earth, by
God," the words coming out aflame with passion as
if his soul were rent with bitter protest.  Which
indeed it was.
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" I suddenly cried, pointing in the
direction of our house, from which we were not far
distant now.  "Oh, Gordon, quick, what's that?" as
the dread sound fell upon my ear again.
</p>

<p>
For a dread sound it was indeed.  I do not know
that I had ever heard it before&mdash;certainly not more
than once, and then when but a child&mdash;but it had the
awful note that can be best described as the baying
of furious and avenging men.  The Southern heart, I
fancy, would recognize it anywhere, just as a huntsman's
child would know the far-off voice of hounds.
I have heard many sounds since then, sounds that
might well strike terror to the stoutest heart, but none
so fraught with the savage omen of death and doom
as the voice of strong and noble men when they are
maddened with revengeful hate and aflame with thirst
for blood.
</p>

<p>
Gordon was already hurrying.  "Good heavens,"
I heard him murmur as we turned a sudden jog in
the road, "what a furious scene!  They're mad,
Helen, they're mad," he cried as we hurried closer;
"what on earth means this?&mdash;look, they've got a
halter round the wretch's neck."
</p>

<p>
"Take me home," I said faintly, pointing towards
the house, now but a few yards from us.
</p>

<p>
"What does it mean, I say?" he repeated huskily,
pressing on as though he did not hear.
</p>

<p>
"It means death," I faltered; "they're going to
kill him&mdash;&mdash;  Oh! take me home," as I clutched his
arm and staggered half fainting towards the door.
</p>

<br /><br />
<i>THE LYNCHING</i>
</h3>

<p>
Needless to say the household was astir.
For our house had a fatal location&mdash;at least,
so it proved that night&mdash;standing as it did
in a quiet part of the town close to the long bridge
that spanned the river.  And the crowd was making
for the bridge; this was to serve as a scaffold.
</p>

<p>
Uncle was not at home.  He had gone forth
about midnight, as my aunt told me.  A few
minutes later he returned, but only for a moment, to
explain the cause of his absence, and to tell them
not to expect him till they saw him.  His eyes were
bloodshot, my mother said, and his lips were dry.
Yet uncle was the most peaceable of men&mdash;but this
one thing seems to make savages out of the mildest
of Southern gentlemen.  It was the old story; this
wretched negro had assaulted a woman on the
street, a poor ignorant white girl who had been
sitting up with a sick friend, and who thought she
could slip unattended across the couple of blocks that
separated her from her home.  He had dragged her
into an alley&mdash;but God sent somebody.
</p>

<p>
None of these infuriated men&mdash;and they
comprised the flower of our population, many of them
men of wealth and culture&mdash;had ever heard of the
woman upon whom the black had attempted
violence.  But this mattered not&mdash;had she been the
beauty of the city, or the belle of the South itself,
their fury could not have been greater.  She was
white; he was black&mdash;that was enough, esteemed by
them as a warrant from God Himself.  For no
thought of the right or wrong of their deadly zeal
ever took possession of their minds.  No knight of
the middle ages was ever more sincere in the ardour
that gave the Crusades their glory.  If ever men
believed they were doing God service, they were these
hot-hearted men who hurried their trembling
sacrifice onward to the bridge.
</p>

<p>
My aunt had put out the lights; whether to
render the house less conspicuous, or to help us see
the better, I do not know.  For few words passed as
the three white faces peered out at the wild scene
before us.  The moon had risen now, and we could
see the faces of some of the men, though many were
in masks.  A peculiar quietness seemed to come
over the throng as they came closer to the bridge,
once so tense that we could catch distinctly the
pleading wail of the central figure, tugging
desperately at the rope around his neck.  Poor creature,
he knew not the ways of Southern men; or perhaps
he did&mdash;and yet one drowning in mid-ocean would
still swim towards the shore.
</p>

<p>
We saw them drag the miserable culprit on to
the bridge&mdash;then we turned away.  I suppose every
Southern woman would cry out in horror at the
thought of following them thus far&mdash;and every one
would have done the same as we.  Yet now we
turned, faint, from the window&mdash;that last dread
scene was for other eyes than ours.
</p>

<p>
But suddenly we heard a mighty shout, marvelling
what it might portend.  A kind of gleeful cry it
was, as if something had been discovered, or some
better plan devised; which proved to be the case.
For I looked again, and lo! they were bearing the
wretch back from the bridge.  A swift vision of
mercy quickened my heart, for I took this to be a
reprieve.  Yet the doomed man seemed reluctant to
be moved, clinging desperately to the railing of the
bridge&mdash;for his hands were free.  The rope about
his neck tightened as they dragged him back, and
when it relaxed I could hear his piteous appeals,
breaking now into loud wails of anguish.  They
dragged him on.
</p>

<p>
In a moment all was clear.  A large post, or pole,
stood close beside the bridge; towards this they
hauled him, new zeal seeming to animate the breast
of every executioner.  I saw two or three of the
younger men running towards the pole.  They had
something in their arms.  It was wood&mdash;and a hot
flush came over me from head to foot.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, God," I moaned to myself, "they're going to
burn him," and even as I spoke they were tying the
struggling man tight to the post, others piling the
wood up about him.
</p>

<p>
In an instant all was ready&mdash;and I caught the
gleam of a lighted match.  I stood, transfixed with
horror.  Then I felt my aunt and my mother tugging
faintly at my dress, clutching at my arm, their
faces averted meantime.
</p>

<p>
"Come away; for God's sake, come away," they
pleaded, faint and sick at heart.
</p>

<p>
I was just obeying and had already turned from
the window, when I heard a shout, full of savage
wrath and protest&mdash;whereat I turned and looked
once more.
</p>

<p>
And my eyes fell on a scene that even yet, after
all the intervening years, I cannot recall without a
bounding heart.  For suddenly from out the crowd
there had rushed one man, tall, powerful, clothed in
black, his face as savage as the others, though it was
savagery of a different sort.  He has told me
since&mdash;though we have only spoken of it once or twice
through all the years&mdash;that his own life was as
nothing to him that night.  He saw nothing but
hundreds of bloodthirsty men, and one guilty wretch,
and the first lick of flame about his feet.  Out from
the crowd had Gordon rushed with sudden impulse,
and, when my eyes fell on him, the sticks and
faggots were going this way and that, some by his feet,
some by his hands outflung.  Then, before the
wonder-stricken men who were closest to him could
interfere, he had trampled on the two or three already
lighted brands, trampled them in fury deep into the
ground.
</p>

<p>
Then he stood before them; he was close beside
the black, whose quivering face was upturned to his
in an agony of pleading.  There he stood, a mighty
figure of a man; at least, so he appeared to me as I
gazed, petrified, at the awesome scene.  And his
pose was the very incarnation of defiance as he
towered above them, his face aflame with
indignation and courage and contempt.
</p>

<p>
Then I saw a movement in the crowd&mdash;or felt
it rather&mdash;that chilled my heart with terror.  I
knew what would happen now, knew it, with
unerring instinct&mdash;and I trembled as a fawn quivers
when it hears the first low cry of distant dogs.
And swiftly, silently, scorning both aunt and
mother, I flew through the door on to the porch,
down the steps, gliding like a shadow till I found
shelter behind an ancient elm on the outskirts of
the swaying crowd.  I was as safe there, and as
unobserved, as though I had been a hundred miles
away.
</p>

<p>
It only took a minute, but Gordon had begun to
speak before I got there, his quivering voice ringing
like a bell through the night.  The men before me
were just beginning to recover from the first shock
of surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Who is that &mdash;&mdash; fool?" I heard one
enquire, not more than four feet ahead of me.
</p>

<p>
"I know him," a voice answered.  I recognized
the informant at once&mdash;he had been to our house
for supper only a few nights before.  "He's a parson
that's visiting the Lundys.  A &mdash;&mdash; Scotchman," he
went on contemptuously; "his father's a collie dog
over there&mdash;takes care of sheep on the hills, he told
me."
</p>

<p>
I knew how helpless I was, but my blood was
boiling.  I shook my fist at the horrid creature from
where I stood&mdash;I could have lynched <i>him</i>, right
then and there.
</p>

<p>
"If you must kill him before he's proved guilty,"
came Gordon's voice, "kill him like white men, not
like Indians."
</p>

<p>
A mighty roar went up at this, and the crowd
swayed nearer to the central figures.  A loud howl
of terror came from the negro.  But the immediate
peril was not for him&mdash;the storm was raging now
about another head than his.  I think a moment
later would have seen Gordon in the clutches of
the mob, had it not been temporarily restrained by
one of the oldest and most honoured of our citizens.
I saw him lift his hand as a signal for silence; in
a moment he and Gordon seemed to be carrying
on an animated argument.  I couldn't hear Colonel
Mitford, for such was his name; but I could catch
Gordon's voice.
</p>

<p>
"I've heard plenty about your Southern chivalry&mdash;would
you lynch a white man if he offered the
same indignity to a black woman as this wretch has
done?"
</p>

<p>
The Colonel seemed to pause for a season.  And
really, it's not much wonder that he should&mdash;I am as
Southern as any one who ever lived, but that question
makes me pause even yet.  Soon the Colonel broke
out again, this time into quite a prolonged speech.
</p>

<p>
"It's all your rightful heritage," came back
Gordon's voice, ringing high; "it's the legacy
slavery has left you.  You're only reaping what
you sowed."
</p>

<p>
At this the clamour was renewed, the crowd pressing
in again&mdash;and I half started from my hiding-place.
But again the Colonel persuaded them to
silence, and again he directed his remarks to Gordon
He was evidently saying something about the
relation of the races.
</p>

<p>
Then came Gordon's thunderbolt: "It seems to
me," he cried hotly, recklessly, "it seems to me you
couldn't have much more fusion than you have
already&mdash;this negro's half white himself;" which
proved more, as I knew it would, than any Southern
man would stand.
</p>

<p>
"Then you can take what you deserve, curse you
for a nigger-lover," I heard the Colonel retort madly,
his voice lost in the roar of hate, the wild outcry for
vengeance that burst from the infuriated crowd.  All
resistance was now swept away, and a few ringleaders
at the front fairly clutched at Gordon.  One had him
by the throat, the others pressing in upon him with
wolfish fury gleaming in their eyes.
</p>

<p>
But before their purpose&mdash;what it was I know
not, nor probably did they&mdash;before it could be carried
out, another rushed to the grim theatre.  It was my
Uncle Henry, his hat gone, lost somewhere in the
crowd.  He leaped to where Gordon stood, and at
his presence the men fell back.
</p>

<p>
"You shan't injure this man," he shouted hoarsely.
"Not that I contend he doesn't deserve it&mdash;but he's
my guest," the word echoing clear.  "He's my
guest," uncle repeated, for he knew the magic of the
word; "he's a stranger amongst us&mdash;and an ignorant
stranger at that.  I'll take the fool home," he went
on, casting at Gordon one of the most contemptuous
glances I ever saw from human eyes, "and I'll deal
with him myself.  I'll promise you to deal with
him&mdash;he's my guest.  And you shall do as you please
with the nigger."
</p>

<p>
I think the storm abated for a moment.  Perhaps
it would have subsided altogether, for stranger is a
sacred name to Southern ears.  But suddenly Colonel
Mitford, still ashy pale with wrath, shouted to the
crowd:
</p>

<p>
"He said they couldn't have more white blood in
them than they've got&mdash;he said we're blended now,"
the words ending in a half snarl, half cry; for if there
is anything under God's sky that makes Southern men
drunk with fury it is just such a statement as Gordon
had been rash enough to make.
</p>

<p>
Some one else shouted a confirmation of the
Colonel's words, another added something Gordon
had never said; and slowly, relentlessly, the crowd
surged in again upon him.  My uncle was rudely
flung aside&mdash;I could hear his voice in protest through
the storm.  Then, exactly what I feared, some of the
assassins, more maddened than the rest, jerked the
rope from the negro's neck and flung it with a loud
cry over Gordon's head.  This was to the crowd what
the taste of blood is to the tiger, and a fiendish yell
broke from a hundred throats.  It is not likely they
really meant to kill him&mdash;but no one could forecast
the limit of their violence.
</p>

<p>
I wouldn't have cared if there had been a million
men and every man a Nero.  I didn't will to do it,
I didn't know I was doing it, didn't calculate what it
meant at all.  But I just felt I was stronger than
them all, and that it was now or never.  So, without
word or cry, I sprang from behind that ancient elm
and leaped to where Gordon stood.  I could never
remember that I pushed or elbowed through the
crowd; I don't believe I did.  There seemed to be
an open path for me, and in far less time than it
takes to tell I was at his side.  I remember how close
I was&mdash;so close that I caught the gleam of that awful
negro's eyes and felt his breath upon my cheek as he
panted in prospect of his doom.  And in a flash I
had torn that rope from Gordon's neck, flung it on
the ground, stamped on it, as I turned and hurled
defiance at the crowd in one long look that I felt
myself was all of fire.  Then I took Gordon's hand
in mine, pointing silently towards the house.  He
followed me, and uncle walked behind.
</p>

<p>
I don't think the slightest resistance was offered
us.  The only protest was from Gordon himself.  He
would have lingered, had he had his way.  But some
word of mine&mdash;I know not what&mdash;settled that mad
purpose in his mind; and he walked beside me,
towering still, his head more erect, his bearing more
kingly, than that of any of the throng who turned
scornful eyes upon him as we went.
</p>

<p>
We were almost through the crowd when something
happened that almost brought the mist of
unconsciousness before my eyes, my head reeling, my
heart spinning like a top.  A voice, instantly familiar,
spoke Gordon's name, hurling an epithet of contempt
and hate so malignant that he turned a moment, as
if he would seek and punish his assailant.  Then he
smiled disdainfully, took my arm tighter in his own,
and walked calmly on.
</p>

<p>
I too turned&mdash;and the face I saw was the face of
Charlie Giddens.  His gaze met mine, and he sought
to smile; but I could see his enmity to Gordon
gleaming through it all, and I hope my eyes bore
themselves as my heart would wish.
</p>

<p>
When we gained our home aunt and mother received
us with weeping joy.  But uncle uttered never
a word.  Instead, he went silently about the house,
drawing tight the shutters on every window that
looked upon the scene we had just deserted.  For he
knew what was transpiring now.  As he came down
the stairs, I met him in the hall and flung my arms
about his neck.  Not a word of chiding escaped
his lips&mdash;he stroked my hair, and his tenderness was
the tenderness of farewell.
</p>

<p>
I told him, with trembling voice, that I had seen
Mr. Giddens in the throng.  This did not surprise
him.  "I know it," he said; "he came in on the
eleven o'clock train&mdash;he heard the noise, of course,
and came up.  Listen," he suddenly cried, as we
heard a footfall on the porch, succeeded by a
gentle knock at the door, "what's that?  That'll be
him&mdash;go inside, child," as he walked to the door to
open it.
</p>

<p>
Gordon was sitting in the corner of the room,
offering speech to nobody, when Mr. Giddens came in.
The latter bowed with courtly grace to my mother
and my aunt, casting on me a glance that showed he
still hoped&mdash;perhaps more now than ever.  Then he
walked straight over till he stood in front of Gordon.
</p>

<p>
"Laird," he said, before any one could speak,
"you've tried to ruin my happiness&mdash;and I've got to
settle with you yet for that."  Gordon sprang to his
feet.  "And you've outraged the sentiment of this
city&mdash;and you've disgraced this home," the words
coming out like pistol-shots, "and I want to know
what you've got to say for yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing&mdash;to you," said Gordon, his face looking
a little terrible, his voice overflowing with contempt.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Giddens turned livid&mdash;and he made a motion
backward with his hand, a motion familiar to all
Southern men; it was towards his pocket.  "If it
weren't my respect for the house we're in," he hissed
through his teeth, "I'd shoot you like a dog."
</p>

<p>
Gordon's face was now altogether terrible.  He
stepped closer to the Southerner, his eyes fastened on
him like balls of flame.  "I've heard other cowards
talk like that," he said.
</p>

<p>
Then Mr. Giddens' hand flew forward, unarmed;
and he struck Gordon full in the face.  We were too
late&mdash;we might as well have raced with lightning.
Before we could speak or move, Gordon's mighty
grip was on his throat, and he wrenched him back,
back, till his head struck with a thud against the
corner wall.  There is something marvellous about
these Scotchmen when madness seizes them.  So
reserved, so silent, so inscrutable, there is no race on
earth so calm and none so deadly.  And strength&mdash;such
fearful strength!  Still gripping him with grasp
of iron, Gordon drew back his hand, every muscle in
neck and wrist standing out like whip-cords as he
gathered force for the blow.
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly his hand fell to his side; he seemed
to shake himself free from his passion, as a man
wakens himself from sleep; the mighty struggle
showed in the quivering voice.
</p>

<p>
"I could kill you," he said with fearful quietness;
"I could kill you now&mdash;go," as he released his
antagonist, already purple.
</p>

<p>
Holding his hand to his throat, the hot blood cooled
by now, Mr. Giddens staggered over towards my
uncle.  "Mr. Lundy," he began thickly, "we expect
you to deal with this cur&mdash;as you said you would.
He's brought disgrace on you&mdash;and he's insulted
every lady in the South by what he did to-night&mdash;and
we look to you to treat him as he deserves."
</p>

<p>
There was a queer smile about my uncle's mouth.
For nearly a minute he did not speak, did not even
look towards the man who had addressed him.  Then
he turned slowly round.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Giddens," he began, in a voice that sounded
strange from him, "I'll deal with him.  Yes, sir, I
reckon I'll deal with him."
</p>

<p>
"I knew you would, Mr. Lundy," the other
returned eagerly; "I knew no Southern gentleman&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But I'll deal with you <i>first</i>, sir," my uncle
interrupted stormily; "you knew&mdash;you knew, did you?
Perhaps you didn't know that no gentleman allows
another man to insult his guest.  And that's what you've
done, sir&mdash;that's what you've done&mdash;you struck a visitor
in my house, struck him in the face, sir.  There's
the door, sir&mdash;the street's the place for you,&mdash;go,"
his voice rolling like thunder now.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Giddens ventured an amiable smile, stepping a
little nearer to my uncle.  I think he partly held out
his hand.  "Mr. Lundy," he began in a conciliatory
tone, "I meant no disrespect to you.  This really
isn't necessary, Mr. Lundy.  You and I were friends
before we knew this&mdash;this Scotchman&mdash;was on the
earth.  And it seems a pity&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Go," thundered my uncle, pointing to the door.
Then suddenly his voice grew white with ungovernable
wrath, and he whipped a shining pistol from his
pocket.  "Go, by heavens," he cried huskily; "I
had this ready for the nigger&mdash;but you'll get it if you
speak another word.  Go out that door&mdash;or you'll be
carried out, by God," as he advanced nearer to the
already retreating man.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When we were alone and all was still again, uncle
silently motioned me to follow him.  Gordon had
already departed in silence to his room.  Uncle took
me into his own apartment and shut the door behind
him.
</p>

<p>
"Helen," he began gravely, "I shall speak no
word to&mdash;to your friend.  Not a word.  You must
tell him."
</p>

<p>
"Tell him what?" I asked, who had no need to ask.
</p>

<p>
"I reckon you know," my uncle answered quietly.
"He can stay here no longer, of course."
</p>

<p>
"No," I assented, my voice choking.
</p>

<p>
"But he needn't leave to-night&mdash;tell him he can
stay the night.  But to-morrow," he concluded
significantly.  I nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Will you go to him&mdash;some day, I mean?" he
asked after a long pause.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I faltered, with downcast head; "yes, some
day."
</p>

<p>
"And leave me, Helen?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"And your mother&mdash;and Aunt Agnes?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I murmured low, the hot tears dropping
from my eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you know he can never come back here
any more?" he began after a little, the words coming
slowly and sadly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I answered; "yes, never any more."
</p>

<p>
"You're foolish, Helen," and his own voice was
choking as he came over and put his arm around me.
"When you remember he's a stranger; and then,
your mother and I and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Is that all?" I interrupted, sobbing.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said slowly, "yes, that's all."
</p>

<p>
"Then I'll tell him," I said brokenly; "I'll tell him
now."
</p>

<p>
I stole up-stairs to the attic and knocked at Gordon's
door.  He opened it; then asked me if I would come
in.  I looked around; he had begun his simple packing.
But he did not speak.  Then I held out my arms&mdash;and
I heard him murmur "Thank God" while he
held me tight, so tight, as though he would never let
me go.
</p>

<p>
I faltered out that uncle didn't want him to go
until the morning.
</p>

<p>
"It's morning now," he said firmly, "and I'm just
ready to go," from which resolve I was powerless to
dissuade him.  "I'll stay at the hotel till to-morrow
evening," he added.
</p>

<p>
"But there's a morning train," I interrupted,
looking up at him.
</p>

<p>
"I know&mdash;but I'm not going till the evening," he
said quietly.  I knew what he meant.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he disengaged my arms and held me out
in front of him.  "Helen Randall," he said solemnly,
"will you come to me?"
</p>

<p>
I buried my face again where it had been before;
my tightening arms gave him answer.  Then he
kissed me, kissed me&mdash;only twice, I think&mdash;but he
kissed me as maiden never was kissed before.  And
he bade me go; which I did after I had clung to him
once more.  And I remember how his poor face was
bruised, where he had been struck the cruel blow.
</p>

<p>
I went to my room.  Soon I heard him going
down the stairs.  I knew, from the sound of his
steps, that he was carrying his valise.  He saw Aunt
Agnes in the hall, I believe, the only one who was
there&mdash;and to her he said his last farewell.  I heard
the door close gently; I could catch the dying
footfalls echoing through the night.
</p>

<p>
I opened my door before I went to bed.  Something
was resting against it.  Picking it up eagerly, I
scanned it beneath the light.  It was the old Scotch
psalm-book from which Gordon had sometimes sung.
And the page was turned over to mark one of the
psalms&mdash;the forty-sixth&mdash;which he had indicated with
heavy strokes.  My eyes swam as I read the great
lines over and over again.  They seemed just meant
for us:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "God is our refuge and our strength,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In straits a present aid;<br />
  Therefore although the earth remove,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not be afraid."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It refreshed me like a breath of mountain air to read
the words; I was still murmuring them when I crept
into bed.  I resolved to try and learn the tune that was
set to the noble psalm&mdash;Stroudwater it was called&mdash;and
I wondered when I would sing it to Gordon in
our own little home.
</p>

<p>
All of this, I remember, made me think that perhaps
I wouldn't make such a bad minister's wife after all.
I really loved the psalms.  Yet I must confess, before
this chapter finds its close, that a girl's heart takes a
long time to change.  I fear I was very weak and
frivolous after all; I know I thought far more of
Gordon, and of his love, than I did of religion or of the
life-work that awaited me.  Because, just as sleep was
coming down about me, I found that my willful heart
was chanting far other lines&mdash;and they seemed sweet
and precious:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Still must you call me tender names,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still gently stroke my tresses;<br />
  Still shall my happy answering heart<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep time to your caresses."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was to their music I fell asleep, and I slept like a
little child.  But I have come to think long since that
the song and the psalm were not such distant relatives
after all.

<br /><br />
<i>GIRDING ON THE ARMOUR</i>
</h3>

<p>
The year that followed Gordon's departure
for the North was my growing year.  It
was the sweetest, dreariest, love-brightest,
loneliest year of all my life&mdash;and it was, as I have said,
my progress year.  I mean, by that, it was the year
which led me farthest in to the real secret of living
and the real springs of life.  Of course, it was a
desolate twelvemonth; I never saw Gordon's face from
its beginning to its close; and this was a new side of
life to me, to discover that I could miss any one face
so much.  Nothing pleased me more than the
sadness that used to settle down on me every now
and then, especially in the twilight hour, when the
dear absent one filled all my thought.  There was a
kind of royal state about my widowhood&mdash;if that
sombre word can be applied to such a hopeful year&mdash;that
made me feel I was set apart from all other girls,
especially from those who had their happiness on tap
right at their hands.  Mine seemed to be fed from
far-off fountains, farther up the hill; and I felt a kind
of envious pity for those whose unromantic luxury it
was to see their sweethearts every night.  I walked
by faith; but they by sight, I thought, paraphrasing
a text of Scripture&mdash;which, it occurred to me, was the
proper thing for a girl with such ministerial prospects
as my own.  But I suppose they pitied me in turn;
which only goes to show what a self-rectifying world
this is.
</p>

<p>
Besides, so far as my own household was concerned,
I was deliciously alone.  I learned, in this connection,
something of the martyr's mysterious joy.  If there
was one thing beyond another that made me love
Gordon more and more wildly every day, it was
that my family hardly ever spoke his name.  Excepting
mother, of course; she was still my mother, if a
disappointed and saddened one&mdash;and sometimes great
freshets of tenderness and sympathy flowed from her
heart over into mine.  But uncle was so stern about
it all, so consistently silent.  If he had been a
rejected lover himself he couldn't have handed me
Gordon's daily letter more solemnly than he used to do
when he came in with the mail.
</p>

<p>
These I always read alone in secret, putting them
away afterwards with reverent hands&mdash;and I kept the
key myself this time.  And such letters as they were!
I could be famous over all the world, if I chose to
publish the love-letters of Gordon Laird&mdash;they were
a combination of poetry and fire.  Yet I had always
read, and heard, that Scotchmen, even when in love,
were as reserved and cold as their native mountains.
Perhaps they are&mdash;but my Scotchman must have been
a Vesuvius, with Eolian harp accompaniment, as the
world would concede if they could once get their eyes
upon his letters.
</p>

<p>
I valiantly renounced everything I thought
questionable for a girl whose promised husband was a
minister of the Gospel.  I gave up cards, of course,
though not without a pang.  Sometimes I still went
to card parties, but I never did anything worse than
punch the score cards, which I could do quite
dexterously.  I never cared for the business though; if
there's a mean occupation on earth, it's punching
score cards while everybody else is having all the fun.
I fancy I felt a good deal like those famous pugilists
that drop down at last to holding a sponge, or something
of that sort.  I began, too, to take a faint interest
in temperance; forswore claret punch forever;
thought seriously, for several weeks, of giving up
syllabubs; even went so far at table as to ask Aunt
Agnes if she thought brandy sauce was quite the
thing.  Aunt said I didn't raise the question till after
I had had two helpings.  With regard to "the light
fantastic," I never danced anything stronger than Sir
Roger; used to play, sometimes, while the others
waltzed&mdash;but that's deadly dry, like punching score
cards, or holding a sponge when your fighting days are done.
</p>

<p>
About the brandy sauce, mother told me after
that I needn't worry.  Did I know how expensive
brandy was, she said.  And I had already told her
how much salary Gordon was getting in his mission
field in Canada.  There is no need to mention it
here&mdash;but it was mighty little.  He had a country
station, somewhere in the rural districts; of which,
to my mind at least, Canada seemed to be almost
entirely composed.  For all I knew of that Dominion
was from the geography we learned at school; it
gave only a few paragraphs to our nearest neighbour
nation&mdash;and these were clustered round a picture
that would chill you to behold, the picture of a man
without coat or vest, knee-deep in snow, lifting up
his axe upon the trees of the forest.
</p>

<p>
Gordon's letters, of course, were full of his work
and his people.  And they didn't contain much that
would likely attract a girl brought up as I had been.
Little gatherings of people, mostly in country
schoolhouses, deadly singing&mdash;which must have been hard
on Gordon&mdash;rude companionship, humble lodgings
and humbler fare, long rides and walks, scant results
for all his toil.  But he seemed to love his work and
his people, and never complained.  Once or twice
he said they were woefully conservative in their
theology, and that they were sternly set against all
the views of modern scholarship, even though they
didn't know what they were.  To tell the truth, I
didn't know myself, but I felt uneasy at the term;
far from religious though I was, I yet always felt that
there were no doctrines worth the name except the
old ones&mdash;the older the better, thought I.  And
when I asked Mr. Furvell about it he said he hoped
Gordon wasn't a disciple of Robertson Smith, and
added something darkly about a "higher critic."  I
didn't know exactly what this last might be&mdash;the
adjective might apply to Gordon all right, I reckoned,
but I didn't like the noun.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, we were going to be married; that was
the principal thing to me, and I went bravely on
making preparations for the greatest event of all my
life.  I hadn't much to bring Gordon as a
dower&mdash;practically nothing, indeed&mdash;for my mother's modest
income left no margin for that, and was so bequeathed
that it could not survive her.  But I wanted to bring
him a good true heart and a sound body&mdash;with a
few lovely things to clothe it.  Every girl wants
that, or ought to, at least.
</p>

<p>
Of course, it was a sad feature of the case that
we were not to be married at our own home.  I
suppose we might have been.  In fact, mother told
me as much, and I knew she had it straight from
uncle.  But I knew right well that it couldn't be a
happy wedding there, with matters as they were;
and, besides, it would have raked into fire the
smouldering embers of that awful blaze that I have
told about already.  And the whole town would
have been agog&mdash;not in the way, either, that every
girl likes a town to be when she gets married.  So
it was arranged that our wedding was to take place
quietly in Baltimore, at the house of a girl friend of
mine whose marriage had taken her there to live.
Gordon was to meet me there&mdash;though I really
believe he would have preferred to beard the lions in
their den&mdash;and mother was to go North and see me
launched on this unknown sea.
</p>

<p>
The first time I was ever angry with Gordon was
about six weeks before our wedding day.  He wrote
me a long letter, full of details about the humbleness
of his position, and the slimness of his
prospects&mdash;and the scarcity of his cash.  He wanted to
go ahead, of course, he said; but he thought it only
fair to tell me, accustomed as I had been to a life
of comparative luxury, of the great sacrifice I was
making, and to give me a chance even yet, should I
shrink from it, to etc., etc.  I wrote him that very
night and I told him I'd marry him if we had only
the north side of a corn-cob to live on, which I
inwardly thought was a pretty vigorous stroke and
worthy of a nimbler pen than mine.  Gordon always
kept that letter, he told me long after, lest the corn
crop should ever fail.
</p>

<p>
It was a lovely wedding, though there were
only four people besides ourselves to see it.  Gordon
held my hand so tight in his; and what I felt the
most, and gloried in, was this&mdash;that he was so
much stronger than I.  My gown looked beautiful,
they all said; and I cried a little&mdash;two things
that are necessary, it seems to me, to any really
successful wedding.  I remember how Gordon
cautioned me to be careful about packing my lovely
dress, because, he explained, he wanted his people
to see me at my best.  This struck me as rather
odd, considering the class of people I was to live
among&mdash;I fancied a linsey-woolsey would please
them as well as anything else.  And I wondered
when I would ever get a chance to wear the beautiful
creation.  But I had no idea of the surprise that was
in store for me.
</p>

<p>
Mother went home by train.  My husband and I
started on our way by boat.  It was a sweet and
delicate suggestion on Gordon's part that we should go
southward again for a day or two, to begin our
married life under the dear familiar skies I loved so well.
Wherefore we set sail that evening, exactly at seven
o'clock, on the Old Bay Line, our destination to be
Old Point Comfort, which we would reach the following
morning.
</p>

<p>
It is really a pathetic thought that the bridal joy
comes only once into a maiden's life, so quickly past
and gone.  It leads, no doubt&mdash;or ought to lead&mdash;into
a deeper peace and a more steadfast love; but it
leads, too, away from the tranquil care-free days of
youth, on in to the storm and stress of life's long
battle.  I remember yet, with a thrill that never seems
to die, the rapture of that hour as we steamed slowly
out from Baltimore.  There were not many
passengers&mdash;none that we had ever seen before.  We were
alone&mdash;together.  And by and by we found a place
on a deserted corner of the deck, our chairs close
together, our hands sometimes passionately clasping as
we looked out over the darkening bay and thought in
silence of the waiting years through which we were
to be parted never more.  By and by the rising moon
clothed the bay in a robe of glory; and thus, with love
and light about us, as happy as though no storm could
ever disturb our lifelong way, we started on the long,
long journey we were to take together.
</p>

<p>
"I've got some news for you, dear," Gordon suddenly
startled me by saying.
</p>

<p>
"Do tell me quick, Gordon," said I.  Only Gordon
wasn't the name I used.
</p>

<p>
"Try and guess."
</p>

<p>
I thought a moment.  "They've papered that old
house," I said, "without waiting till I came," for
Gordon had told me that the natives of his country
parish had designs on the old stone manse against my
arrival.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," he said, laughing.  "No, it's good
news&mdash;at least, I hope it may turn out to be."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," I exclaimed, drawing a long breath, "I'm so
glad&mdash;the paper they'd choose would give me the
jimjams, I know.  Well, tell me."
</p>

<p>
"We're not going to the old stone manse at all,"
he said, turning and looking radiantly at me in the
moonlight.  "We're not going to Rocanville&mdash;I've
got a call, Helen."
</p>

<p>
"Where?" I gasped, leaning forward with my elbows
on his knees, caring not who saw.  "And why
didn't you tell me&mdash;&mdash;  Oh, Gordon, did you feel
you couldn't trust me?" my voice trembling a little
as the first pang of conjugal sorrow smote my bosom.
</p>

<p>
He laughed; then stooped and kissed me, having
previously cast a swift Scotch glance about the deck.
"I'd trust you with my life, my darling," he
murmured&mdash;which comforted me a good deal.  "But I
wasn't exactly sure till two or three days ago&mdash;and I
wanted to surprise you&mdash;and I wanted always to think
that when my Helen gave herself to me, she thought
she was going into the wilds for love's sweet sake.
So it will always be just as precious to me as if you
had actually gone."
</p>

<p>
"But where are we going?" I pressed eagerly, not
lingering on the sweetness; "don't keep me waiting,
Gordon."
</p>

<p>
"To Old Point Comfort," he said with the most
provoking deliberation.
</p>

<p>
"Don't tease me, dearest," I protested.  Wonderful,
isn't it, how brides always employ the tenderest
names when they are just a little bit exasperated.
</p>

<p>
And then he told me where it was we were to begin
our married life.  The church that had called us
was named St. Andrew's; and it was the leading
church, Gordon said, in Hertford, a Canadian city
that shall so be named.  "At least," he hastened to
add, "it's the richest church, has the richest class of
people in it&mdash;whether that makes it the leading church
or not."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm so glad," I exclaimed breathlessly, my
face aglow.  "So that's why you wanted me to be so
careful of my wedding dress?  Isn't it all like a
lovely fairy tale?  And are we going there right
away?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;after we leave Point Comfort.  I'm to be
installed there a week from to-day&mdash;and there's to be
a reception to us in the evening."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, lovely!" I cried; "I didn't think I'd get a
chance to wear my finery at all.  Do tell me all about
it, Gordon," as I snuggled closer in the moonlight.
The deck was gloriously deserted now.
</p>

<p>
"There isn't much to tell," he said, and I wondered
why he wasn't more jubilant about it all.  "They
invited me to preach before them a few weeks ago.  I
went&mdash;never dreamed they would call me, though.
But they did.  And the church isn't such a very large
one&mdash;but it's very fashionable; too fashionable, I
fear.  A minister isn't always happiest in a church
like that, you know," and again I caught the note in
his voice which showed he didn't regard the prospect
with unmixed enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"But I know we'll be happy, dear," I reassured
him, quite frank in my exultation; "that class of
people will suit you so much better.  They'll
appreciate you&mdash;you'd have been wasted on those
common people at that other outlandish place."
</p>

<p>
"Not wasted, dear," he answered quietly; "a
man's never wasted where he does his best.  But
I'm glad for your sake," he went on more brightly;
"I don't think I'd have gone, only I thought you'd
be happier there."
</p>

<p>
"I'd be happy anywhere with you," I replied in
bridal bliss.  "I'd have come to you just the same if
you'd been assistant minister of an Indian church at
the North Pole.  But I'm glad," my happy words
went on, "I'm so glad we're going to be among
congenial people.  And I'm sure we'll have a lovely
time&mdash;we'll have a lovely social life, I mean."
</p>

<p>
"I hate social life&mdash;society life, at least," Gordon
suddenly broke out in a voice that quite startled
me; "and if they think I'm going to be a gossipy
tea-drinking parson, they'll soon find their mistake."
</p>

<p>
"But, Gordon," I remonstrated seriously, "you
shouldn't look at it that way.  Consider the influence
you can have over them&mdash;that is, through their social
life.  I think the minister of rich people has the
greatest chance in the world&mdash;to do them good, I
mean.  And I'll help you&mdash;I'll help you, dearest."
</p>

<p>
"How?" my husband enquired after a little pause.
</p>

<p>
"Well," I answered slowly; "oh, well, I like that
sort of thing.  I'm not much good, you know,
at&mdash;at&mdash;religious work, prayer-meetings and things," I
floundered on; "but I can&mdash;I can do that part,
because I like it.  I'll try and help you, Gordon&mdash;in
that department, you know," I concluded, realizing,
I fear, that it wasn't a very heroic field.
</p>

<p>
"I want my little wife to help me in all the
departments," he answered, smiling.  "And you will,
won't you, dearest&mdash;you'll love my work for its own
sake, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
Which I promised swiftly.  "But I think I'll love
it more in that kind of a church," I added frankly,
"than I would at Rocanville.  And of course I
won't play cards with them, or dance&mdash;or anything
like that," I affirmed piously, looking to Gordon for
an approving smile; "but I suppose it won't be any
harm for me to go to those things, will it, dear?"
</p>

<p>
"I hadn't thought of that," he said, looking out
over the shining bay; "but I want my wife to find
her life-work in mine&mdash;and to help me be a truer
and better minister, no matter where our field of
work may be."
</p>

<p>
All of which I promised, with the gladdest,
happiest heart.  And I told Gordon I wanted him
to write me out a little prayer, a kind of missionary
prayer, for opening meetings with, and all that sort
of thing.  Gordon said I was a ritualist.
</p>

<p>
Then we arose to go inside, for the night was
growing chill.
</p>

<p>
"Is there any danger, Gordon," I asked as we
walked through the saloon, "any danger, do you
think, that my trunks won't get to Hertford the
same day we do?  They have the reception that
night, you said."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," he said; "the trunks have gone on
ahead already."
</p>

<p>
"I'm so glad," I answered; "it would be too bad
to begin our work there with&mdash;with any handicap
like that, you know."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap15"></a></p>

<h3>

<br /><br />
<i>"OUR LADY OF THE SNOWS"</i>
</h3>

<p>
It was evident there were plenty of rich people
in St. Andrew's, as Gordon had told me.  I
hadn't been half an hour in the parlours of the
church that evening of our reception before I was sure
of that.  My trunks had come to hand all right,
and my wedding splendour was making what show
it could, but it soon found its level among the costly
gowns that were worn by many a fair dame that
night.  If I had wanted abundant evidence that
Gordon was to be minister of a fashionable church,
I had every reason to be satisfied.  I had never seen
so much rich religion in any one organization.
Although, of course, the evening wasn't very much
on the religious order.  There was an opening
prayer, I think, and the good brother who offered it
prayed that they might all go out into the highways
and byways and compel them to come in.  I
remember thinking most of them would have to
change their clothes before they did any highway
duty of that kind&mdash;and I felt sorry for the wanderers
that might be introduced.
</p>

<p>
The people were very kind and cordial in their
welcome.  But I could see they expected me to
realize what a superior sort of people they were, and
what a fortunate sort of individual I was.  They
nearly all shook hands in the high pump-handle
fashion that was almost unknown in the South;
and they managed, in divers little ways, to let
me know they were a very elaborate aggregation
of Christian folks.  I rather thought one
or two of the best groomed of them looked at
me as if I had no right to be so decently clothed
myself.
</p>

<p>
The evening was far spent when, as my husband
was talking to a lady, a very important looking man
came up and shook her solemnly by the hand.  "We're
glad to welcome you, Mrs. Laird," he said; "I have
already met your husband&mdash;and I hope you'll feel
at home amongst us."  Whereat Gordon got quite
excited.  "Oh," he broke in, "this is not my
wife&mdash;here," as he beckoned to me, "this is Mrs. Laird"&mdash;and
I hurried forward.  I cast a swift glance at the
woman he had taken for me, and my cheeks burned
with indignation.  She was very religious, as I
learned afterwards&mdash;but she was forty if she was a day,
and dressed as if she had just come out of the ark,
and wore a bonnet that might have been an heirloom
in the family.  However, I forgave her, being secretly
thankful that it was not I.  She was a stranger, I
learned, from another church.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes Mr. Ashton&mdash;for such proved
to be the gentleman's name&mdash;was deep in conversation
with me and Gordon.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he went on, after some casual remarks,
"your husband has fell on his feet all right."  I started
a little at the grammar; for Mr. Ashton was bedecked
in the best of clothes, and had one or two diamonds
about his person into the bargain.  "We had forty-three
applications when our pulpit became vacant&mdash;and
it was quite a strain, picking out the man.  You
see, this is a very remarkable congregation," he went
on in quite a wealthy tone, "and it's not every man
could just suit us.  But I think you'll give us exactly
what we want, Mr. Laird," he added, turning to
Gordon; "your style suits me exactly," and he smiled
very amiably at my husband.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't anything but the Gospel, Mr. Ashton,"
Gordon replied, a little distantly I thought, "and I
suppose that's what any of the forty-three would have
given you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," replied Mr. Ashton, toying with a
ponderous seal that dangled from a very elaborate
chain, "the Gospel's the thing.  Give me the Gospel&mdash;and
the old Gospel too&mdash;none of your new-fangled
ideas for me.  No man could have got St. Andrew's
pulpit if I'd thought he believed there was two Isaiahs.
You don't believe in those new-fangled notions, of
course, do you, Mr. Laird?"
</p>

<p>
Gordon flushed slightly.  "I don't concern
myself much with whether a truth is old or new," he
answered presently, "so long as I believe it's
the truth.  Even if it comes from the critics, I
welcome truth from them as quickly as from any
other source."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, certainly," said Mr. Ashton loftily,
knitting his brows the while, "to a certain extent,
that is.  But the old doctrines are good enough for
me.  And&mdash;as I was saying, Mrs. Laird&mdash;we've got
a very rich congregation; very rich," he repeated,
drawing in his breath, "and, I hope, not without a
sense of its responsibility too.  Last year we had a
surplus of eight hundred dollars&mdash;no regular salary to
pay, you see&mdash;and on my own motion, on my own
motion, we voted seventy-five of it to foreign missions.
None of us felt the poorer for it, I'm sure&mdash;and I hope
we'll be kept faithful to the end," he went on piously,
"faithful to the end, Mr. Laird," as he turned again
and smiled at Gordon.
</p>

<p>
"I'd have gone in for giving the whole thing to
missions," Gordon ventured boldly.
</p>

<p>
"Very good, Mr. Laird; very good indeed, to a
certain extent.  But we never expect our minister to
bother with the finances," he said patronizingly.
"Our last minister got into trouble that way&mdash;was
always preaching about the poor; talked a great deal
about giving, and that sort of thing&mdash;used to preach
some very worldly sermons.  And our people didn't
take to it, didn't take to it at all, Mrs. Laird.  To be
quite frank, our people want the Gospel and nothing
but the Gospel&mdash;I'm that way myself; none of your
financial or political sermons for me," he concluded
quite significantly.  "If our minister looks after his
pulpit and gets up the kind of sermons we expect him
to give, we'll&mdash;we'll run the finances all right,
Mr. Laird."  Then he dangled his glittering fob again
and smiled up at Gordon; for Gordon was half a head
higher than he.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid we're keeping you too much to ourselves,
Mr. Ashton," Gordon suddenly broke in, offering
me his arm and starting to move away; "the
others will want to speak to you," as he smilingly
withdrew, a light in his eyes that I could interpret
quite well, lost though it was on our prosperous
parishioner.  Before we left, Gordon enquired quietly
about Mr. Ashton, and we learned that he owned a
huge factory and was quite the richest man in the
church.  One or two declared he ran the whole
institution, and that whatever he said was law.  I don't
think this cheered Gordon very much.
</p>

<p>
The two years that followed were trying ones for
me.  It seemed as if I were on exhibition on every
hand, and I felt nearly all the time as if I were at
some kind of a public meeting.  The church had no
end of societies, especially women's societies, and
they all expected me to be present on every
occasion.  I did my best but it was pretty hard.  I
memorized the little prayer Gordon had written out
for me&mdash;and broke down in the middle of it the first
time I tried to deliver it.  It was like being lost at
sea.  And one of the ladies afterwards, whose
husband was very rich&mdash;he made it out of lard&mdash;told
me not to be discouraged; she said their previous
minister's wife made a living show of herself, time and
time again, before she got to be able to pray properly.
So I stopped right there, without further exhibition.
</p>

<p>
I bravely attempted teaching a class in the
Sunday-school.  Things didn't go so badly for the
first three Sundays, although the boys asked some
questions that dreadfully embarrassed me; I told
them they must think these things out for
themselves.  But the fourth Sunday two of them fell to
fighting&mdash;over a big glass alley&mdash;and they had a
quite disgraceful time.  There was bloodshed.  It
really quite unnerved me, as I didn't know the
minute they might break out again; so in about six
weeks I gave that up.
</p>

<p>
Another thing discouraged me a good deal&mdash;and
that was that we were comparatively poor.  Although
the congregation was composed so largely of rich
people, they seemed to think&mdash;and Mr. Ashton
openly avowed&mdash;that nothing injured a minister's
spiritual life like having too much money.  So we were
kept pretty safe that way.  But there was one lovely
thing about the salary&mdash;and that was, the manse;
within which Gordon and I made our home as soon
as we came to Hertford.  It seemed a little small to
me in comparison with uncle's big house at home;
but we fixed it up till it was as sweet and cozy as any
little home could be, and Gordon's delight was
something to behold.  He said it was like a palace to him,
and I was its lovely queen.  This was very melodious
to me, for when Gordon said pretty things he meant them.
</p>

<p>
However, it was rather trying, after all, to be so
much harder up than many of our people.  Some of
these seemed to love to ask me why we didn't keep
horses; and whether or not we were going to Europe
this summer; and how many servants we employed.
They knew right well all the time that we had enough
to do to keep ourselves, and that we were about as
likely to go to Mars as to Europe&mdash;it comforted me
a little to know I could have gone if I hadn't fallen
in love with Gordon&mdash;and as for servants, we had
only our red-headed Harriet; but she was first cousin
to the wife of one of the richest men in the church.
Their fathers were brothers, Harriet told me exultantly;
but Harriet's had remained a mechanic, while
Mrs. Newcroft's had become a manufacturer.  Harriet
generally got one afternoon in the week off;
Mrs. Newcroft soon found this out, and always chose that
day to call, lest Harriet should greet her as Mary
Ann&mdash;which, in my opinion, she had a perfect right
to do.
</p>

<p>
It was a funny aristocracy we had in Hertford&mdash;about
as cheerful, and hopeful, and mushroomy an
aggregation as you could find anywhere.  So different
from the South, it was; wealth didn't cut much
of a figure with our old Southern families.  But the
patricians of Hertford, for the most part, had bought
their way to the seats of the mighty; and nearly all
the blue blood was financially blue.  Some of the
grand dames had been servants themselves in their
early days; which was no disgrace to them, I'm sure,
only it was amusing to see how they looked down on
servants now.  In fact, I often felt how discouraging
must have been their arduous efforts to build up an
aristocracy at all; things would have gone pretty
well, had it not been for some mean old outsiders
who would insist on remembering back thirty or
forty years.  Those within the sacred circle
generously forgot&mdash;each for the other.  They let bygones
be bygones, to their mutual advantage.  But outsiders
had cruel memories.  Wherefore, just when they were
getting their aristocracy nicely established, some of
these inconsiderate old-timers would go rummaging
in the past; and, the first thing we knew, they would
stumble on an anvil, or unearth a plough, or a hod,
or something of that kind&mdash;whereat the blue-blooded
had to begin all over again.  For the descendants of
hod, or plough, or anvil, had somehow developed the
greatest scorn for these honest trade-marks of other
days.
</p>

<p>
Gordon never said much to me&mdash;I heard him use
the term "Shanghai nobility" once, with a smile&mdash;but
I knew how he despised it all.  I could see his
eye flash sometimes when some of them were getting
off their little speeches, trying to let us know in what
lofty society they moved and what superior folks
they were.  Indeed, it became more and more clear
to me that Gordon was never meant to be the
minister of a rich congregation at all.  His father
was a shepherd&mdash;it used to mortify the grandees of
St. Andrew's dreadfully to hear him say so&mdash;and
Gordon was full of the simple sincerity and manly
independence that I felt sure must have marked his
ancestors.  And I don't think Gordon ever preached
a sermon without unconsciously making them feel
that he was independent of them, if ever a man was,
which was the simple truth, for my husband had
his warrant from far higher hands than theirs, and I
don't think he knew what it was to feel the fear of
man.
</p>

<p>
Wherefore it came about, and it is not to be
wondered at, that Gordon found a great deal of his
work among the poor.  Little by little, to the
dismay of many of the aristocrats, he added to the
number of the lowly that made their church home
in St. Andrew's.  And he founded, and cherished, a
mission chapel in Swan Hollow, one of the most degraded
parts of the city.  I really believe the rich were
jealous of the poor, for Gordon seemed to love them
best and to be happiest when he was among them.
But the poor people worshipped him for it&mdash;and I
believe I did too.
</p>

<p>
Oh, how I envied him!  For he seemed to have a
source of happiness of which I knew nothing.  I can
remember, when my days were full of teas, and
at-homes, and all sorts of social functions, how much
more full and satisfying his life seemed to be than
mine.  Sometimes I would get Harriet to make a
little jelly, or some delicacy of that sort, for the poor
sick folks he used to tell me about; but Gordon gave
them his heart, his life, his love&mdash;and that made all
his work a perpetual joy to him.  This was the deep
spring from which he drank&mdash;and I had no part in it
at all.  I used to punch the score cards at evening
parties, and sometimes I played for the dancers as
before&mdash;thus did my poor hungry heart nibble at the
phantom crumbs that fell from the rich man's table.
But both my heart and I were starving.
</p>

<p>
It strikes me as wonderful, now that I sit and look
back upon it all, how inevitably, and by what different
paths, and under what varying influences I came
closer to Gordon's side.

<br /><br />
<i>A KNIGHTLY GUEST</i>
</h3>

<p>
"Do you suppose we could afford a carriage
for the Ashtons' dinner?" I asked Gordon
one evening, the evening before the
function in question.
</p>

<p>
Gordon hesitated.  "I'm afraid not, my dear," he
said; "surely it isn't very far to walk."
</p>

<p>
"Everybody else will have one," I remonstrated, a
little ruefully.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he answered cheerfully, "most of them can
afford it better than we can.  And those who can't,"
as he smiled, rather disdainfully I thought, "a good
many of those who can't, will have one just the same&mdash;even
if they daren't look the butcher and the baker
in the face.  There are a good many like that in
Hertford, you know&mdash;in St. Andrew's Church, for
that matter, I'm afraid," he added.  "But a minister
couldn't afford that any better than the other," he
concluded, reaching for the elaborate invitation I held
in my hand the while.
</p>

<p>
"Gordon," I said suddenly, and I fear my face
showed what prompted the question, "have you ever
thought what a good time we'd have had, if you had
been something else&mdash;if you had been a doctor, I
mean, or a politician, or something of that sort?  Or
a lawyer," I added; "yes, a lawyer&mdash;what a stunning
lawyer you'd have made, Gordon.  You'd be getting
five times your present income, if you'd been a lawyer."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense," he said, in his rather blunt Scotch way.
</p>

<p>
"It's nothing of the sort," I answered.  "You know
as well as I do there are a dozen lawyers in
Hertford who could buy and sell you over and over again,
so far as money is concerned&mdash;and they haven't got
half the brains you have&mdash;aren't in the same class
with you as public speakers.  And yet here you are,
the minister of a lot of fashionable people and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We have a good many now that aren't fashionable,
thank heaven," he interrupted, as if he were
quite proud of it; "you'd be surprised, Helen, if you
only knew how many poor people have connected
with St. Andrew's since I came.  But that doesn't
please you much, does it, dear?" a shadow coming
over the eager face.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" I asked.  Yet I knew the meaning and
the truth of his words.
</p>

<p>
"You don't love the poor people," he answered,
his words coming slow, as if with pain; his eyes
pleadingly fixed on mine.
</p>

<p>
"What makes you say that, Gordon?" and my
voice shook a little.
</p>

<p>
"Because I see it every day, dear.  You don't care
for that part of my work at all," and his voice was
inexpressibly sad.  "I know what you mean by
what you've just said&mdash;about wishing I had been a
lawyer."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't say I wished it&mdash;you know I didn't," I
corrected vigorously.
</p>

<p>
"But that's what you meant.  I know it&mdash;I've
known it long.  Oh, my darling," he suddenly broke
out, like one owning at last to a long-hidden pain, "do
you think I've been blind to it all?  Do you think I
haven't seen the noble efforts my brave little wife has
made to be interested in my work&mdash;and all her
disappointment that we're poor and humble&mdash;and her
longing for the things that I can never give her.  And yet
you've been so lovely and unselfish about it all, my
dear one, trying to hide it from me," and I could feel
my cheeks burn with shame at the words.  One of
his arms was partly round my neck, his hand toying
with my hair; and he drew me close and held me
tight.  The shelter was wondrous sweet.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Gordon," I said, the tears coming as I spoke,
"don't talk to me like that; please don't&mdash;you know
I was so young.  And I never had any experience
like this&mdash;I was brought up so differently.  And I do
want to be happy&mdash;so much, I want to be happy.
And you, dear, I want you to be happy too."
</p>

<p>
"And so I am," he exclaimed passionately&mdash;"except
that I'm lonely; I'm so lonely, Helen.  Oh, if
you only loved the things I love, the poor, the sick,
the sorrowing&mdash;if you only loved them all, and loved
to help them&mdash;I wouldn't trade places with the
richest and the grandest of them all."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Gordon," I sobbed, "how could you say it?&mdash;you
mean you'd trade now!  And I've tried so hard."
</p>

<p>
He soothed me, caressing and comforting as though
I were a child.  "It's been hard for you, my
darling," he murmured in my ear; "and you don't
know all you've been to me&mdash;you really don't."
</p>

<p>
"It was only because I thought you were so
clever," I sobbed out like a baby; "and I thought
you weren't&mdash;weren't getting your reward."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, child, you don't know what rich rewards
there are," he said dreamily; "what rich rewards&mdash;if
men only knew where to look for them."
</p>

<p>
I lay a long time in his arms, the imposing
invitation unheeded on the floor.  And I longed&mdash;I
believe I prayed in a faint kind of way&mdash;that I might
yet know something of the secret joy that made up
my husband's hire.  Yet I was almost in despair; for
the image of all that others did, and all they had, and
the vision of what might also have been ours, kept
recurring to my mind.  I thought our life was pretty
gray, its limits hard and stern, and I may as well be
candid enough to say so.  But I think I would have
followed Gordon anywhere&mdash;if I could only have
found the way.  My gropings for it must have been
pathetic.
</p>

<p>
"I'll give up the Ashtons' dinner," I said
heroically at last, looking up at Gordon through my
tears.  I knew he would kiss me&mdash;and he did.
</p>

<p>
"But you shan't," he said firmly.  "You'll go&mdash;and
so will I.  That's the one little triumph I'll
never give up; I'm always so proud of my wife at
times like that&mdash;we can beat them on their own
ground."  Then he stooped down and recovered the
gleaming-edged cardboard from the floor.
</p>

<p>
This invitation was our passport to what was
evidently to be a very swell dinner at the Ashtons'.
They had a lion in the house&mdash;a mighty guest, I
mean by that.  He was a Sir; not only a Sir, but a
Baronet; which, it seems, is a loftier brand, a
repeating kind of Sir.  His full name was Sir Austin
Beachcroft, and he was a British brewer.  His
appearance gave abundant indication that he was one
of his own best customers.  Mr. Ashton, it seems,
had met him while crossing the Atlantic, and the
Baronet was graciously stopping off for a visit of a
day or two on his way to the Rockies to hunt
grizzlies.  He arrived on a Saturday night; and it
was impressive to see the solemn hush that came
over the congregation in St. Andrew's when the
Ashtons led their Baronet down the aisle the next
morning.  Mr. Ashton came first, and there was a
look on his face that showed his doubt as to whether
or not he was a mortal man.  They came late, of
course, but I attribute that to Mrs. Ashton&mdash;for that
is a womanly wile.  I caught a glimpse of her face
as she passed&mdash;it bore a look of thankfulness, almost
of heavenly bliss, as if she were now ready to depart
in peace.  In an adjoining pew I could see Harriet's
cousin; vainly she strove to join the swelling psalm,
gazing at the procession as though she considered
the ways of Providence unjust.
</p>

<p>
The Baronet, throughout the service, bore himself
as piously as though he had never heard of beer.
Yet it was evident enough that he never for one
moment forgot that he was a creation of his Sovereign.
When the hymns were being sung, he looked
abstractedly in front of him, as though they were
addressed to him; at sudden intervals he would
break in and sing about half a line, just to show that
he was human like ourselves.  Every now and then,
while the sermon was in progress, he would cast a
swift glance around to make sure that everybody
was looking at him; finding that they were, a little
jerk and a stare heavenward evinced the slight irritation
that rank or genius is supposed to feel in being
thus remarked.  Once or twice he snapped his
watch when Gordon didn't stop just when he might
have done.  This set me against him at once, for
the sermon was a beautiful one; besides, I knew
what ailed the Baronet&mdash;he wasn't accustomed to go
so long without a sample of his wares.  When the
collection was taken up, he was human enough;
even Mr. Ashton started a little at the size of his
deposit; for he gave after the fashion of his fathers,
which, as Gordon afterwards told me, was formed in
the copper age.
</p>

<p>
Well, the very next night came the dinner; to
which Gordon and I sallied forth.  It does make a
woman wince a little when she finds herself coming
on foot to a gate quite surrounded by the carriages
of her fellow guests.  Harriet's cousin, I remember,
alighted from her equipage just as I arrived, and we
went in together; it was but poor comfort to reflect
that my servant called her Mary Ann.
</p>

<p>
"You're the belle of the ball," Gordon whispered
to me as we came down the stairs a few minutes
later; "I'll bet a sovereign the Baronet will write
home about you before he goes to bed."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be surprised," I answered gaily, "if I
take to the woods as soon as I meet him&mdash;you
know, I never saw a real two-legged lordling
before."
</p>

<p>
We were duly presented, the Baronet staring at us
as though we were so many pretty fawns reclaimed by
civilization from the wilds.  Harriet's cousin was as
red in the face as a turkey-cock, and her attitude was
one of reverence itself.  Mr. Ashton stood apart in
a state of semi-unconscious bliss, looking like a kind
of glorified Barnum.  His wife was torn between
feverish glances towards the glittering table that could
be seen in the distance and longing looks fixed upon
the Baronet.  She was wondering how she might
properly surrender herself to be borne in to dinner.
</p>

<p>
In due time, however, we were all seated, my
escort proving the wealthy husband of the woman who
had comforted me about my prayer&mdash;he was the
magnate who had made his money out of lard.  My
first remark to him, after we were seated, disclosed
my ignorance of the proper pronunciation of his name.
I suppose I was nervous.  He corrected me, adding
in fine original vein: "But call me what you like, as
long as you don't call me too late for dinner,"
spreading his napkin over an expanse that indicated his
counsel was probably serious enough.
</p>

<p>
At this juncture Mr. Ashton asked Gordon to say
grace; and the tone of his request showed how highly
honoured he considered both the Almighty and his
minister to be by the observance.  This finished,
there followed that peculiar silence which so often
wraps a self-conscious company, all of whom are bent
on conducting themselves with unusual propriety.
</p>

<p>
But the Baronet was soon in midstream, his spirits
rising higher and higher as he remarked the deference
with which his every word was greeted.  "Yes," he
was saying when I first caught the drift of his talk,
"I had a great time in New York&mdash;was fairly beset
with their reporters, though, all wanting interviews.
They're a great lot, those New Yorkers," he went
grandly on, "nearly all of them either colonels or
millionaires&mdash;any one who isn't one or the other is
sure to be a judge.  Greatest conglomeration of
newly rich I ever saw in my life&mdash;but it's wonderful
how they worship what they haven't got.  A lot of
humbugs," he added scornfully, "pretending to
despise titles the way they do&mdash;and yet they fairly
worship them.  The Duke of Marlborough happened
to be in New York the same time as me; and, really,
there didn't seem to be anything else in the papers
except our movements&mdash;we simply couldn't sneeze,
without it being in the papers.  Oh, they're very
young yet," he added patronizingly, "they're very
young indeed."
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Laird's a Yankee, Sir Austin," one of the
lady guests ventured timidly, designating me by a
sideward glance.  I dare say I wasn't hard to
identify, for I know my cheeks were blazing and my eyes
flashing.  It's wonderful how much dearer your
country grows when you're in exile.
</p>

<p>
The Baronet adjusted his monocle and looked at
me with some interest across the table.  "Well," he
began with a very condescending smile, "there are
some nice Yankees, you know&mdash;for instance,"
nodding at me as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not a Yankee," I broke in with vehemence.
"I'm no more a Yankee than you are, sir."  I forgot
all about the handle to his name.
</p>

<p>
"Were you addressing Sir Austin?" Mr. Ashton
interrupted, meaning reproof; he was so horror-stricken
that he had brought his erstwhile busy jaws
to a sudden standstill.
</p>

<p>
"I was addressing anybody who calls me a Yankee,"
I retorted, controlling a voice that would shake in
spite of me.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mrs. Laird," the informant of a moment ago
interjected, "I always understood you were an American."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I am," I returned, commanding a smile
by this time&mdash;"but that's a very different being from
a Yankee.  And I don't know whether I am or not,"
I went on with a quite ardent heart; "because I'm a
Southerner&mdash;my father was a Confederate soldier," I
broke out, regardless of the canons of good taste,
"and he was wounded twice at Gettysburg, so he was."
</p>

<p>
"Did he recover?" the Baronet enquired, in a
tone that was meant to be sympathetic.
</p>

<p>
I stared at the man.  "Did he recover?" I echoed;
"how long do you think it is since Gettysburg was
fought, Sir Austin?"
</p>

<p>
I verily believe the title was music to the man.  In
any case, he mellowed perceptibly.  "It was a
foolish question&mdash;from any one who has ever seen you,"
he admitted; "and they were a brave lot of men,
even if they did get beaten," he continued cordially
enough; "they put up a great fight, did those rebels,
Mrs.&mdash;er?" as he paused for my name.
</p>

<p>
This was too much.  "They weren't rebels," I
flung back; "nobody has a right to call them rebels&mdash;they
were soldiers fighting for their country&mdash;and
they weren't beaten, they were starved," I added;
and I wouldn't have cared if he had been the proudest
duke in England.
</p>

<p>
The lordlet adjusted his monocle afresh and took a
wondering look at me.  I do not know what reply,
if any, he was about to make; for just then came an
interruption fraught with more of consequence than
would have appeared likely on the surface.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Laird's wanted, sir," announced a servant.
Wherewith Gordon excused himself for a moment
and hurried out to the hall.
</p>

<p>
"I'll have to ask you to let me run away, Mr. Ashton,"
he said, returning after a brief absence.
"I'm afraid I'll have to go."
</p>

<p>
"What!" exclaimed our host incredulously;
"have to go!&mdash;the dinner's only just begun, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I'm very sorry," replied my husband, "but I've
been sent for&mdash;somebody wants me, and I must go,"
with which he turned back into the hall, for
Mr. Ashton had already risen from his chair.  He was
still protesting as he followed him out; the talk
around the table began again, but I could still catch
the conversation in the hall.
</p>

<p>
"You can't possibly get away; I was counting on
you, as you know, to propose the health of Sir
Austin.  I'll send word that you'll come the first
thing in the morning&mdash;whoever it is that wants you."
</p>

<p>
I couldn't catch the response; but I knew right
well what line it would take.
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't think they belong to St. Andrew's,"
I heard Gordon a moment later; "not as far as I
know, at least.  They're very poor, I should fancy,
from the quarter they live in."
</p>

<p>
"Then it seems to me you're under no obligation
to go," I could just hear Mr. Ashton saying, in a
tone that chilled me; "you'll find it quite enough,
I imagine, to look after your own people.  What's
the matter anyway?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Gordon, "but the messenger
said they wanted me right away&mdash;it's a matter of
duty, Mr. Ashton."
</p>

<p>
Just with this Mr. Ashton drew the door shut
behind him.  I did not wait to analyze the impulse
that suddenly seized me, but hastily arose, with a
word of apology to my hostess, and slipped swiftly out
into the hall.  I do not think either of the men
noticed me.
</p>

<p>
"Well, all I've got to say is this," Mr. Ashton
was exclaiming, "that I consider it a slight to my
guest&mdash;a downright slight, sir; an insult, I might
almost say, to Sir Austin Beachcroft.  And I know
he'll have his own opinion of it, sir&mdash;and you can
explain to him yourself&mdash;I'll make no apologies for
you, mind."
</p>

<p>
Gordon replied just the way I would have expected
him to: "I don't care a rap for all the Sir
Austins in the kingdom," he said, moving on up the
stairs to get his coat; "it's probable some one's
dying&mdash;and wants me."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ashton followed a step or two up the stair.
"I suppose I may take that to mean," his voice now
thick with anger, "that you don't care a rap for me
either; nor for anybody else of the people that&mdash;that
hire you&mdash;and pay you, Mr. Laird," the words coming
hot and hissing, his flaming face turned up towards
Gordon at the top of the stairs.
</p>

<p>
I could see Gordon's eyes flash from where he
stood.  "If you think I'm your hired servant,
Mr. Ashton&mdash;or anybody else's, when my duty's
concerned&mdash;you'll find out your mistake.  We needn't
carry this discussion any further," as he turned and
went into the dressing-room.
</p>

<p>
"I'll carry it further, sir," Mr. Ashton half shouted
in a tone so loud I feared his knightly guest would
hear; "I'll carry it till I teach you which side your
bread's buttered on&mdash;I'll see you from the pulpit to
the door.  It was me that got you here&mdash;and I'll
get you out, sir, I'll get you out," he flung as a
parting threat, turning to make his way back to the
dining-room.
</p>

<p>
My course was clear.  I passed our angry host
without a word as I climbed the stair; the most
ardent days of love and courtship had never found
my heart so hungry for the man I loved as it was
that moment.
</p>

<p>
"You must not come," said Gordon, as I swept
into the room where he was.  "What made you
leave, dear&mdash;please go back.  Things are bad enough
as they are."
</p>

<p>
But I sealed his lips with my burning own and
held him one moment in my arms before I turned
to make ready for departure.  I could see his face
brighten with a wonderful light, and I had my
reward in the pride and fondness with which his eyes
rested on me.
</p>

<p>
Nobody intercepted, nor did any speak to us,
as we made our way out to the street.  The night
was dark, a few heavy rain-drops beating in our
faces.
</p>

<p>
"Where are you going now?" Gordon asked me
as we moved away from the gate.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said I&mdash;"only I'm going with you."
</p>

<p>
"My darling!" was all he said.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid there's going to be a storm," I
predicted, looking up at the ill-omened sky after we
had walked a little way in silence.
</p>

<p>
"The storm is past," he said, his arm stealing
about me in the dark; "the night is growing
beautiful to me&mdash;oh, my wife, my darling!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<br /><br />
<i>MY ORDINATION</i>
</h3>

<p>
We had walked for perhaps fifteen or
twenty minutes before we came near our
destination, the character of the neighbourhood
gradually indicating that the spot we were
seeking was near at hand.  One or two enquiries
sufficed to locate the house, a tumble-down old
cottage that stood in a little from the street.
</p>

<p>
"Be you the minister?" asked a woman's voice,
as she opened the door in answer to our knock,
shading the lamp with her hand; "be you Mr. Laird?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Gordon, "I came as soon as I got
your message; and what can I do for you?"  Although
I think he surmised why she had sent for
him; there is that in a mother's face and voice which
only one kind of sorrow gives.  Besides, he had seen
a light burning dimly in the little room at the end of
the house.
</p>

<p>
"It's our Jennie," the woman said, standing
transfixed a moment as the light of the lamp fell on me.
For I was still in my dinner dress; and I was holding
the train up in my hand, and there were flowers
in my hair.  Neither of us, I imagine, had thought
of this.
</p>

<p>
"This is my wife," said Gordon; and I never
heard him say it with more tenderness or pride&mdash;nor
had it ever sounded sweeter.
</p>

<p>
The sad and tired face, still wondering, gave me a
faint smile of welcome as we passed within the door.
</p>

<p>
"You can stay in the room," she said, leading the
way into what I supposed they might call the
parlour.  At least, there was a table in it, and one or
two chromos on the wall; but I noticed a dishevelled
couch in the corner, evidently for some tired
watcher.
</p>

<p>
"Jennie's been wantin' ye for long," the woman
said to Gordon as she set the lamp on the table;
"but she's worse the night, an' me an' Martha got
afraid.  Besides, she was askin' for ye; she went to
the Bethany Sunday-school, sir, and she often saw you
when you was there"&mdash;this was Gordon's mission
school&mdash;"you put your hand on her head once, at
the festival, I think, an' poor Jennie never forgot it,
she was that pleased.  But I'm feared she'll never be
back there again, sir," the woman's voice quivering
as she turned her face away.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter with your daughter?" I asked,
for my whole heart went out to the woman in her
grief.
</p>

<p>
"Well, ma'am, we don't hardly know.  But it began
with a cruel bad cough more'n six months ago&mdash;an'
it keeps always gettin' a little worse.  She got
it at the factory&mdash;her and Martha both worked in
the knittin' factory, an' the air was so bad, and the
hours was so long; but she just had to keep workin'
on, ma'am, 'cause their father's dead, and there's two
younger than them.  I earn a little now an' again,
goin' out washin'&mdash;but it was really Jennie and
Martha that kep' the home goin'," the woman
concluded, heaving a weary sigh.
</p>

<p>
"What factory was your daughter in?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, in Mr. Ashton's&mdash;Ashton &amp; Quirk," the
woman answered, "an' they don't seem to care
anythin' for the hands&mdash;excep' gettin' the work out o'
them," she added, with another sigh; "Jennie
wanted to stop and rest, first along, when she wasn't
feelin' good&mdash;but they said another girl would get
her job if she stopped.  So she had to go on as long
as she could.  I guess we'll go in now, sir; we won't
be long, ma'am," as she led Gordon from the room.
</p>

<p>
As I sat alone I could hear the dull hacking
cough at frequent intervals, sometimes with sounds
of struggle and of choking.  Then would come a
stillness, broken by the low sound of voices; and
soon I could catch Gordon's rich tones in prayer.  I
could not hear the words, but a nameless power
seemed to accompany the sound; I knew that his
very heart and life were being given to the holy
task.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later Gordon came softly into
the room where I was waiting.  "Come on in,"
he said; "come on in and see Jennie.  I'm sure it
would do her good."
</p>

<p>
I hesitated.  "Is she dying?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
Gordon nodded.  "It's consumption," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Gordon, don't ask me to go.  I'm so
frightened of death; and I couldn't help her any&mdash;I
couldn't say a word," for if I ever felt my helplessness,
it was then.  "I'm afraid I would only be in
the way," I supplemented, not without much
sincerity.
</p>

<p>
"A loving heart's never in the way," my husband
answered in the lowest tone.  His face, radiant a
moment before from its sacred duty, was now
shadowed with sorrow; his eyes gave me a final
glance of loneliness and longing as he turned to go
back to the dying bed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Gordon, wait," I cried faintly, sudden resolve
gathering in my heart.  "Wait, darling, and I'll go,"
with which I hurried to his side.  My reward was in
his eyes.  I could see them, even in the darkened
hall through which we passed into the room of death.
</p>

<p>
Such a humble room it was, bare and unadorned.
The bed stood in the corner, and even my untutored
eyes saw at a glance that life's race was nearly run
for her who lay upon it.  Large, dark eyes looked
out at me from the wasted face, wistful in death's
mysterious appeal.  Poor Jennie! she little knew how
great was the ministry yet remaining to her.
</p>

<p>
For, as in a moment, the repulsion and the fear all
left my heart, filling fast with a pity and a longing I
could neither understand nor control.  It must have
been God's prompting, and nothing else.  I saw
nothing but the dying face.  The mother was
there; and Martha, her cheeks wet with tears; the
younger pair, too, were standing near the bed.  But
I seemed to behold none of them&mdash;not even Gordon.
</p>

<p>
For I moved instinctively towards the bed, my gaze
fixed on the dying girl.  Her eyes seemed to call
me; the lure of the eternal was within them, and I
marvelled, little of spiritual insight though I had, at
the deep tranquillity that lay far within.  She smiled
as she saw me coming closer, and I sat down on the
bed beside her.
</p>

<p>
I could not but notice that her eyes rested on my
face in eager wonder; she seemed to love to look,
so constant was her gaze.  And it was evident&mdash;so
eternal is the womanly&mdash;that she was attracted by
what I wore; my lovely gown, the lace upon its
bosom, the diamond pendant with its chain about my
neck, the rich flowers in my hair&mdash;all made their
appeal to the dying eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it was lovely!" she murmured, after we had
spoken a word or two.
</p>

<p>
"What was, dear?" I answered, for I had no idea.
</p>

<p>
"What he said&mdash;what your husband told me.  He
made it so easy&mdash;and so beautiful.  I'm not afraid to
die&mdash;not now, ma'am."
</p>

<p>
I marvelled as I beheld the strange serenity that
seemed to wrap her like a garment.  "Oh," she went
on faintly, "it must be lovely to be able to do that;
to be able to tell people, when they're dying, about
the Saviour&mdash;and about heaven.  Do you do it too,
ma'am?"
</p>

<p>
I shrank before the pervading eyes, for they seemed
to look through and through the soul with the
penetrating power that death imparts.  "No," I said
tremblingly, "no, I don't believe I ever did."
</p>

<p>
"But you will, won't you?" she went on calmly;
"he'll tell you how&mdash;and you'll tell it too.  Oh, it
comforts so&mdash;I believe it because he does," her eyes
turning now in reverence to Gordon's face.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dear, yes, I'll try," I faltered, and the eager
eyes looked content.  Something prompted me to
put my hands to my hair, though I had forgotten the
flowers were there.  "Would you like them, Jennie?"
as I placed them in the wasted hand.  I had no need
to ask, so grateful was the light that kindled the wan
face.
</p>

<p>
"These comfort too," she murmured.  Then suddenly:
"Can you sing?&mdash;I love when people sing to
me, if I love them."
</p>

<p>
"Not very well, Jennie," I answered, for I knew I
could not trust my voice.
</p>

<p>
"Please do," she pleaded; "just some little song."
</p>

<p>
I turned to Gordon; he was standing above me.
"Let us try," he said; "suppose we sing 'Forever
with the Lord'?"
</p>

<p>
I consented.  But a quick impulse came to me
and I whispered to him: "One of your psalms,
Gordon&mdash;that lovely one about the Valley."
</p>

<p>
I saw how glad he was.  "You must sing it too,"
he said; and then, in tones of more than womanly
gentleness, he began the noble strain.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Yea though I walk in death's dark vale<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet will I fear none ill,<br />
  For Thou art with me and Thy rod<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And staff me comfort still."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I didn't know then, and hardly know exactly yet,
what those two last lines really mean; but no one
could fail to see their power.  They have been often
tested when life's lamp was burning low; and the
far-off music of Immortality, whatever be the meaning
of the words, echoes through them.  Jennie's face
was beautiful to see.
</p>

<p>
I had never had hour like to this.  I can remember
yet how, once or twice, the thought of all the
revelry I had left behind floated before my eyes; the
lights, the flowers, the richly appointed table, the
sumptuous dinner, the circle of exalted guests in
glorious array, the speech and the echoing song&mdash;but
they all seemed to me now as the dust beneath
my feet.  Pale and tawdry, garish, did it all
appear in contrast with the high reality of the scene
that had succeeded it.  It must have been God's
miracle to my soul.  I know not.  But I speak only
the simple truth when I say that what was about me
now, the humble home, the squalid room, the dimly
burning lamp, the wail of the broken-hearted, the
pale light of death upon one wasted face; these
stood before me as life, very life&mdash;and the other had
receded into the phantom shadows of unreality and
death.  I felt as if I had found myself at last; I
knew I had found my husband, long sundered by
the cruel shadow my own foolish heart had cast;
and I dimly hoped that the dear Father of us all had
found us both.
</p>

<p>
An hour or two later Gordon beckoned me out into
the little hall.  "I guess we'll have to go now," he
said; "it's almost midnight&mdash;and you'll be tired out."
</p>

<p>
"Don't," I said earnestly, "don't make me go,
Gordon.  How can we leave here?&mdash;she's dying.
Do you think we'll ever see her again?"
</p>

<p>
Gordon's look of love was beautiful.  "No," he
said, "never again, here&mdash;and we'll wait, my
darling," the words coming low and passionate.
"Look," as he cast his eyes within the door, "she
wants you&mdash;she's motioning for you."
</p>

<p>
Which was true enough, and in a moment I was
bending over the dying form.
</p>

<p>
"You'll comfort mother, and Martha, won't you&mdash;and
the children&mdash;when I'm gone?  Poor Martha,
she'll have it all to do now," the words coming faint
and pitiful; "all the work, I mean&mdash;she works so
hard.  And she has to go to the factory, even after
she sits up all night."
</p>

<p>
"I'll do all I can, dear," I promised, trying to
speak calmly, though the tears were running down
my cheeks.  "I'll come and see them as often as I
can."
</p>

<p>
"Call them all," she said, rousing herself.
</p>

<p>
I had not far to call.  In a moment they were all
about the bed.  Then the emaciated arms stole out
and laid hold of a rusty napkin, or towel, that lay
upon the bed beside her.  Slowly she unfolded it,
producing its contents one by one.
</p>

<p>
"This is for you, Ernie," as she handed the
little brother a many-coloured flashing tie; "I saved
up to get it for you for Christmas&mdash;but then I knew
I'd have to get it sooner.  And I made this for you,
Chrissie," as the thin hands held out a little
pin-cushion to the younger sister.  "And I want you
to have my little locket for a keepsake, Martha; it's
nearly new.  And this is for you, mother," as the
sobbing woman bent above her child; "it's my
Sunday-school Bible&mdash;and it has the tickets I was
saving for a prize; I can't ever use them now.  And
the book-marker that's in it is for you," as her eyes
turned to Gordon; "I worked it for you myself, and
I was going to give it to you the first Sunday you
came down."
</p>

<p>
She sank back, exhausted.  One by one they
turned away, each bearing the precious treasure.
Gordon held his book-marker out before him like a
sacred thing, and I could see his breast heaving as
his arm went round one of the children.  My own
eyes were streaming, for I had never witnessed
scene so holy; the last will and testament of prince
or magnate had never majesty like this.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Jennie motioned me down beside her
again.  "I didn't have anything for you," she
murmured in pitiful explanation, "because I didn't know
you were coming.  So I just give you my&mdash;my
love," she faltered low, "and I want to tell you how
much you've helped me&mdash;to die.  And you'll often do
it, won't you?" she went on, reverting to the
request that must surely have been prompted by
none but God Himself, every word burning its way
to my inmost heart.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I sobbed, "oh, yes, I will, if God will help
me&mdash;but I can do so little."
</p>

<p>
"No," she whispered back, "no&mdash;so much.  You
don't know how much it helps, for a poor girl like
me just to, just to see somebody that's&mdash;that's sweet
and lovely," she said timidly&mdash;"and that wears
pretty clothes.  Just to see somebody that loves you,
even if they didn't speak a word&mdash;that helps a lot."
</p>

<p>
I gently hushed the words.  The little circle
gathered around the bed again.  The hours went
slowly by.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly her eyes opened wide.  "Sing that
again," she murmured, struggling now for breath;
"that about&mdash;about the vale.  It's dark."
</p>

<p>
Gordon looked into my eyes; his hand touched
mine.  Then, in a tone that was part of tenderness
and all of triumph, he began, my trembling voice
blending with his own:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Yea though I walk through death's dark vale<br />
  Yet will I fear none ill"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and just as we finished the Shepherd Psalm the
wasted face lighted up with pallid beauty, the
raptured eyes looked their last farewell, and the tired
toiler passed into the rest of God.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was a very solemn joy that wrapped our hearts
as Gordon and I walked home together through the
slowly breaking dawn.  I knew that our life-song
had begun at last, and my heart was filled with
reverent ecstasy.
</p>

<p>
"Take me, Gordon," I said, as we entered and
closed the door behind us.  "Take me," the tears
now flowing fast, "and never, never let me go."
</p>

<p>
"You're mine," was all his answer as his arms
closed about me.  "God gave me you, my darling."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
XVIII
<br /><br />
<i>THE DAYSPRING FROM ON HIGH</i>
</h3>

<p>
It matters not how parched and bare the plain
of life may be, one living spring of joy can
enrich and beautify it all.  One master
gladness can make the heart strong against all the
ills of life; it matters not how fierce and angry be
the winds, if the heart have shelter.  If God be for
us who can be against us?
</p>

<p>
Gordon and I had certainly had our share of the
ills of life; and the winds of trouble had found us
out.  Of course, it doesn't seem so hard to bear, now
that it's past; but I reckon few young married
couples ever encountered more head wind or sailed
more troubled seas.  I know everybody thinks their
own troubles are the worst; if we could trade with
other people for a week, we'd probably be glad to
trade back when the time was up.  Yet it cannot
be denied, so far as we were concerned, that we had
a good deal to sadden us.
</p>

<p>
To begin with, we were far from home and
kindred.  Gordon's relatives&mdash;he seldom spoke of
any but his father&mdash;were far across the sea.  Mine
were a thousand miles away, in the sunny Southland,
separated from me now by the unhappy storm
that had gathered about my husband's head.  We
never spoke of going home; for Gordon, I knew,
would not consider it, and I would not go without him.
</p>

<p>
Then, too, there was little now to take me there.
My mother had passed away.  It was a couple of
years after we came to Canada that the end had
come.  Suddenly stricken with the hand of death
while summering in the remote mountains of Western
Virginia, the dear spirit had found its rest.  I could
not be notified till it was too late to go, even for
the last sad offices; so I went not at all.  The
heavenly tenderness of my husband through all those
days of sorrow lingers with me as a precious memory.
Uncle Henry and Aunt Agnes wrote me once or
twice, and always sympathetically enough.  But it
was evident that they recognized through it all how
wide was the gulf that divided me from the days
and scenes of girlhood.  And they sent their
"respects" to Gordon, which is about the politest form
of epitaph that can be graven on the tomb of friendship.
</p>

<p>
It was in the very midst of this parched and
dreary plain (to quote the words with which I began
the chapter) that a spring of living joy suddenly
flung forth its waters; amid the troublous winds, our
hearts found the dearest of all earthly havens.
</p>

<p>
It seems hard to realize it now&mdash;but I don't
believe Gordon and I were unhappy before baby came.
Unhappy, I mean, because there wasn't any.  I don't
think we ever felt that life was poor and skimped
and silent; I don't believe we looked and longed at
all.  No, we didn't&mdash;and that's the strangest part of it.
The troubles that people with children had&mdash;the
imprisonment by day&mdash;and the marches by night&mdash;and
the plaintive serenades of the early dawn; the care
and responsibility and disappointment, and often
heartbreak, of later years&mdash;these were so frequently
mentioned between us that I fear we came to indulge a
kind of blasphemous complacency because we were
immune.  Then, too, we sometimes whispered the old
sophistry that we had each other, in devotion
undivided with another&mdash;which is nothing but a honeyed
perjury.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow I know this, that in those pre-parental
days I would ask people whom I had just met&mdash;and
with no misgivings&mdash;as to whether or not they had
any children.  But I never dared to do it after the
new love-birds began singing in my mother-heart.  It
seemed cruel, lest they should be compelled with
shame to acknowledge they had none; even in my
most inconsiderate years I would never ask a homely
spinster if her dance card were full&mdash;if I may pluck
an illustration from the giddy days of old.
</p>

<p>
It was with trembling joy that we drew near, never
so near together, to this great gladness of our lives.
Then came my great darkness; then the holy dawn.
I swiftly forgot all about the darkness&mdash;for joy that a
man was born into the world.
</p>

<p>
Gordon was beside me when I realized it all, showering
little timid words of endearment down upon me
as though he feared I were hardly able to stand them.
His lip was quivering when I looked up; and I saw
his glance turn from me to something that lay beside
me on a pillow.  A low gurgling kind of sound came
from the little bundle on the top of it.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't that sweet?" I murmured&mdash;for I knew&mdash;my
eyes fallen shut again.  Gordon looked at me
with overflowing eyes&mdash;then he turned and went
softly out of the room.
</p>

<p>
I was faint and weak when he came back; but I
held his hand, lest he should go away again.
</p>

<p>
"Say a little prayer for the baby," I whispered;
"say it out loud," and Gordon knelt low beside the
bed and prayed.  But I noticed that all his prayer was
for me, that I might be given back to him&mdash;and I told
him, before he had time to get up, that he had forgotten
about the baby.  So he prayed again, for us both this
time; and I don't think I ever before felt what a true
priest of God was this man of mine, and I rejoiced
that the new life which lay beside me was breath of
his breath and soul of his soul.  And I think we both
forgot, in those blessed days, all the sorrows of the
past, the turmoil of the present, the portent of the
future.
</p>

<p>
What a new world it all turned out to me!  A new
heaven, indeed; and a new earth&mdash;which was more
to us just then&mdash;as the Bible says.  Everything was
wonderful.  I can remember yet the foolish delight
with which one day I counted all the baby's toes&mdash;and
found he had exactly ten.  I knew, of course,
that this had happened often enough before, but still
it struck me as beautiful that they should have come
out so even; a miscalculation, considering how many
have to be outfitted for the journey, would have
seemed pardonable in anybody's baby but my own.
And I had never known before how intelligent a baby
could be in its very early dawn.  For instance, mine
had a strange habit of lifting his little hand high above
his head, then slowly letting it drop.
</p>

<p>
"I can't make out what that gesture means," his
father (those words were a new strain of music) said
to me one day as we bended over the babe together;
"you don't suppose he sees that fly, do you?" referring
to a winged intruder that was hovering, like
ourselves, above our treasure.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," I answered; then suddenly, "Gordon,
do you know, I believe I can tell what baby's trying
to do.  He's trying to pronounce the benediction,
just as sure as anything.  That's you in him,
Gordon; he's going to be a minister."
</p>

<p>
"I believe that's just what he's doing," said Gordon,
enchanted; "look&mdash;there he's doing it again."
</p>

<p>
"He does it just like you, Gordon," I repeated.
"Nobody need ever tell me there's nothing in
heredity.  Isn't it wonderful?"
</p>

<p>
"It's mysterious," said Gordon, fascinated as he
watched the little cleric; "we'll have to call him some
name suitable for a minister."
</p>

<p>
"We'll call him Gordon," I said decisively&mdash;"that's
a good Presbyterian name.  I called him that this
morning, all alone, and he looked up and cooed like
as if he understood."
</p>

<p>
"We'll call him Harold, for your father, if you
like," my husband proposed magnanimously.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," I said, "his name shall be Gordon.
But we'll call it&mdash;I mean&mdash;we'll give mother's name
to her&mdash;if he ever has a little sister."
</p>

<p>
"Mercy!" said Gordon, drawing his breath in fast.
</p>

<p>
"I always think just one's so lonely," I explained,
my eyes fastened on the isolated posterity beside me.
"I was just one&mdash;the only one in our family, you
know."
</p>

<p>
"The only one in the world&mdash;for me," said Gordon,
and he kissed me.  "Look, your son's trying to sneeze:
isn't it wonderful how soon they pick things up?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Our</i> son, dear," I corrected reproachfully, after I
had helped baby through.
</p>

<p>
Gordon laughed.  "We're a pair of idiots," he
said.  "We'll have to straighten up, Helen, or we'll
spoil the youngster.  I can see you're going to idolize
him already."
</p>

<p>
"Love never spoiled anybody," I protested, "and
it won't spoil him either."
</p>

<p>
"No," conceded Gordon, "but he mustn't be indulged
too much.  I believe in making them obey&mdash;and
not giving in to them; that old adage about
sparing the rod, you know."
</p>

<p>
"He shan't ever be touched," I exclaimed;
"nobody shall ever lay a finger on my baby."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Our</i> baby," corrected Gordon, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"But about what you said about the rod," I
resumed.  "You don't surely mean&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't let us get excited, dear," and Gordon
smiled down at me; "but of course children, and
especially boys, must be taught to obey.  That's one
of the great advantages of a public school."
</p>

<p>
"He shan't ever go to a public school," I declared
warmly.  "No child of mine will ever be sent with a
lot of common children&mdash;in one of those big schools."
</p>

<p>
"What will you do with them?" said Gordon,
intensely interested.
</p>

<p>
"I'll teach them myself," said I.  "I'll teach them
together; I'll keep them together all the time.
There's no influence on a boy like his little sister."
</p>

<p>
By this time Gordon was just as absorbed in them
both as I was.  "You can train the girl the way you
like," he said, stroking my hair while he spoke;
"that's a mother's privilege&mdash;but I'll have to take a
hand with the boy.  And I'm a firm believer in
punishing them, when they need punishment."
</p>

<p>
"Gordon," I pleaded, as my eyes filled with tears,
"do you mean to say you'd whip him?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Gordon, very solemn; "yes, if he
needs it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Gordon," I cried, for it was all very real to
me, "you'll make him afraid of you; he'll learn
to dislike you, Gordon&mdash;and that would break my
heart," the words quivering as they came.
</p>

<p>
"There, there, dear," he said, gently caressing me,
"don't let us say any more about it&mdash;perhaps I won't
have to whip him much.  All I mean is, that I don't
believe in children getting their own way; we mustn't
indulge him, I mean.  And you know, dear," this
coming with a very winning smile, "you know, I'm
older&mdash;and I've had more experience than you, dear."
</p>

<p>
"No, you haven't, Gordon," I cried triumphantly;
"you shouldn't say that.  I've had just as many as
you, Gordon&mdash;and I know them better; I've studied
him more, right here with him all the time."
</p>

<p>
But just then our solitary descendant broke out
with an imperious cry that indicated he wanted
something.  Gordon leaped to duty.  "It's his bottle," he
exclaimed excitedly, beginning a wild search on the
table, under the pillow, beneath the bed, the quest
continued in the bathroom and an adjoining chamber.
"Yes, yes, baby," he kept saying as he searched;
"yes, father'll get him his 'ittle bottle; he's hungy,
is he, the tootsy wootsy?  Yes, father'll bing it in a
minute."  The much desired article was finally
discovered in the cradle beside the bed; and Gordon, in
full canonicals, knelt lowly on the floor as he pacified
the clamorous lips.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you didn't believe in giving them their
own way?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"He's too little to know the difference yet," said
the bending one, his back to me as he adjusted the
mechanism anew.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Gordon," I said, "you're very young, as a
father&mdash;very young."
</p>

<br /><br />
<i>THE TAINT OF HERESY</i>
</h3>

<p>
Our son was growing into a goodly lad
(everything happened either before or after baby
was born) when it first actually broke on
me that Gordon's Doctorate had been a dear-bought
prize.  For Gordon was now a Doctor of Divinity&mdash;and
he had won it by examination, too, long years
of severe study and wide reading having gone before.
I didn't begrudge the time, and the seclusion, this
had implied; but I just hated the whole thing when
I found out how it had affected Gordon's views.  I
never did believe much in ministers being such
terrible students as many of them are; I verily believe
as many preachers are spoiled by books as are helped
by them, for they often grow less human while they're
growing more profound.  The Bible and the daily
paper&mdash;truth and human life&mdash;some great preacher
pronounced his two main books, and I'm inclined to
agree with him.  Gordon gave me one of his deep
books to read once&mdash;Harnack, I think, was the name
of the man who wrote it&mdash;and I went to sleep over
it for my husband's sake but not for Mr. Harnack's.
Gordon may call that kind of theology new, I
thought, but it's not interesting.
</p>

<p>
The whole thing&mdash;about Gordon's views, I mean&mdash;came
out this way.  Of course I fancy a good many
already suspected he was rather modern in his creed;
especially Mr. Ashton, who became more orthodox
every time he cut the wages of the poor girls in his
factory.  But I never knew, nor any one else, how
far Gordon had drifted from the old moorings, till a
certain evangelist came to hold a mission in
Hertford.  He was a converted prize-fighter&mdash;changed
from a pounder into an ex-pounder, so to speak&mdash;and
he loved to give us a whiff of his malodorous past
every time he got a chance; I reckon he fancied
any one who had had such a violent attack of sin
was immune for the rest of his days.  I went to hear
him several times; but one night he said if he had to
choose between a pack of cards in his house or a
rattlesnake turned loose among his children, he'd take
the snake.  I knew then he was either a fool or a
liar, one&mdash;and I had no mind to listen to either&mdash;so
I never went near him again.
</p>

<p>
However, Gordon was presiding one night when
this man was preaching; and the evangelist suddenly
broke out with the statement that the most moral, or
the most philanthropic, man in the whole world
would get as hot a place in hell as the worst
murderer or thief, if he didn't believe what he ought to
believe.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't that so, Dr. Laird?" he said, turning to my
husband.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Gordon, "it's not."
</p>

<p>
Well, as you may understand, there was something
pretty to pay.  The evangelist nearly fainted on the
spot; as soon as he came to himself he asked them
all to join in prayer&mdash;and he prayed that Gordon
might be converted that very night.  Gordon! whose
shoe's latchet he was not worthy to unloose.
</p>

<p>
"You've denied your Master, sir," Mr. Ashton
accused Gordon afterwards, having waited for him at
the door; "you've repudiated the great doctrine of
salvation&mdash;in the presence of a thousand people, sir."
</p>

<p>
Gordon motioned him aside.  When he told me
all about it afterwards, he avowed himself ashamed of
the degree of temper he had shown, but I said I'd
have been ashamed of him if he hadn't.
</p>

<p>
"What's this you accuse me of?" demanded Gordon.
</p>

<p>
"You aren't fit to be a minister," affirmed
Mr. Ashton hotly; "I'm ashamed of you as the pastor of
St. Andrew's, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" pursued Gordon.
</p>

<p>
"Because our church, sir, our church has always
been noted for its orthodoxy.  We've always held to
the simple Gospel&mdash;and you've gone back on it, sir.
I knew it was coming; I could tell it by the things
you preached about."
</p>

<p>
"What things?" although Gordon knew right well.
</p>

<p>
"Well, take last Sunday for instance; you preached
on the duty of employers of labour&mdash;a lot of stuff
about fresh air, and short hours, and taking care of
sick hands&mdash;a lot of unspiritual stuff like that.
When I go to church, sir, I want the Gospel, the
simple Gospel&mdash;and nothing but the Gospel.
Mr. Seybold's the same way; he says he's disgusted
with many of your sermons, about worldly things.
You stick to the Gospel, sir, and worldly things will
take care of themselves," concluded Mr. Ashton,
wagging his pious head.
</p>

<p>
"You mean Seybold the brewer, don't you?" enquired Gordon.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Mr. Ashton; "and he's one of the
richest men in our church, as you know yourself."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know anything about it," was Gordon's
curt reply; "but I don't wonder at his zeal for the
Gospel&mdash;or yours either.  I don't know any men
that have more need to make their calling and
election sure.  He's a vampire, sir&mdash;and so are you."
</p>

<p>
"A what?" roared Mr. Ashton.  "I'm a what?"  He
did not know what a vampire was, of course; but
there was something in Gordon's voice and eye that
made the word tell its meaning.  Gordon would have
withered him just the same if he had called him a
rectangular hypotenuse.
</p>

<p>
"A vampire, I said," Gordon hurled back at him;
"both of you live on the defenseless and the poor.
It's sickening," and Gordon's voice rang higher, "to
hear you, or him, prating about the Gospel, while he
makes his wealth out of human misery&mdash;and you,
you oppress the poor&mdash;you grind their faces, and you
know it.  You take your blood money from poor
girls that have to toil in that sweat-box of yours&mdash;and
you don't care whether they live or die, so long
as they serve your selfish ends.  I have visited more
than one dying girl that got her death in your
employ&mdash;as Jennie McMillan did&mdash;and you prance your
horses past the door when they're dying, and even
after the crape is on it, and you never stop to ask for
them; and then you come prattling to me about not
preaching the Gospel!"
</p>

<p>
Gordon paused; out of breath, I reckon.  By this
time quite a number of the crowd had eddied back,
listening attentively, you may be sure, to this candid
conversation.  One or two of them gave me a
detailed account later on.
</p>

<p>
"I appeal," blustered Mr. Ashton, "I appeal to
those who know me.  I spoke to you as an officer of
St. Andrew's.  I have been a faithful supporter of
the church&mdash;and I've always paid my debts," he
blurted out irrelevantly, hard put to it to make defense.
</p>

<p>
"Ye ha'ena'," a squeaking voice came suddenly
from the bystanders.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ashton turned sharply round.  "I haven't?&mdash;where's
the man that dares to say I haven't?" he
hectored, searching the group for the interrupter.
</p>

<p>
"I'm the mon," came quietly from the lips of a
little old Scotchman as he moved slowly to the
front; "ye didna' pay oor Jock what ye owed him.
He took the consumption workin' for ye," the
squeaky voice went on, "an' when he lay deein', ye
never lookit near him; an' the day o' his funeral, ye
drove by the hoose wi'oot lookin' at us.  An' he was
a foreman till ye for mair nor twenty year," the
plaintive indictment proceeded&mdash;"an' ye owed him a
wee bit mark o' respec' like that.  An' ye never
paid it&mdash;but it's ower late noo."  Then the little man
slipped back among the bystanders; Mr. Ashton
followed him, loudly protesting that the dead servant
had got his wages regularly, the second Tuesday of
every month.
</p>

<p>
Gordon took advantage of the diversion to move
away; and the story, substantially as I have told it,
was given to me on his arrival home.
</p>

<p>
I did not question him closely about the original
cause of the discussion&mdash;about his theological views,
I mean; but it started an uneasiness that grew upon
me day by day.  And a few weeks later I learned
something more that did not reassure me much.
</p>

<p>
I was sitting with Harold&mdash;we had named our son
Gordon Harold; but the latter half was what we
called him, to avoid confusion&mdash;one evening in the
study; two ministers, visitors to some church gathering
and guests of ours, were talking on the piazza.
By and by Harold grew silent, and so did I; which,
I suppose, led the two brethren to think I had
disappeared.  And they talked freely.
</p>

<p>
"It's too bad," one of them said, whereat I sat up
and listened, "that Laird's gone that way.  He can't
hold those views, and his pulpit, at the same time."
</p>

<p>
"Have you any idea what his views really are?"
the other asked.
</p>

<p>
"They're anything but sound," his friend replied,
"and that's the plain English of it.  Any man who
holds them has no right to be in the ministry."  My
blood began to sizzle.  I knew this reverend brother&mdash;a
comfortable pastor of a comfortable congregation,
who spent most of his time simply trying to be
"sound," to use his own word; saving doctrines
and losing men, as I heard Gordon say once in a
sermon.
</p>

<p>
"What are they?" persisted the other.
</p>

<p>
"Well," began the first, "I don't believe he's very
sound on the miracles.  And then, he contends we're
all divine&mdash;doesn't deny the divinity of our Lord,
however.  But I think he often closes his prayer without
saying 'for Christ's sake'; at least, so I've heard."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps he means it just the same," suggested his
companion.
</p>

<p>
"Then he ought to say it&mdash;a prayer that hasn't
that doesn't go higher than the roof, in my opinion.
And I believe he contends no man can explain the
Atonement&mdash;from an intellectual standpoint, that is.
He told me as much&mdash;I told him I could explain it
all right.  He replied that he interpreted it more by
his heart than his reason.  And that's dangerous
ground, Mr. Forest, very dangerous ground."
</p>

<p>
"Is that all?" the other enquired, evidently not
overcome by the arraignment.
</p>

<p>
"No, it's not.  They say he believes prayer has no
power to influence the course of events&mdash;regards it
only as a kind of pious communion; doesn't believe
in praying for anything in particular, I'm told.  And
he has his doubts as to who wrote the Hebrews.  I
told him it was Paul&mdash;but he still seemed to have
doubts.  And he thinks the Confession of Faith is too
long and too intricate.  That's dangerous too&mdash;it's
the thin end of the wedge, Mr. Forest, the thin end
of the wedge," and from where I sat I could hear the
censor shut his lips.
</p>

<p>
"He's a mighty devoted minister, anyway," the
other interposed; "I've had long talks with him
myself.  And there's only one thing troubles me&mdash;I'm
afraid, I really am, that he clings too much to a merely
ethical Christ.  He's tinged with that, I'm sure;
glories in Him as a Teacher, and Healer of mankind,
and all that sort of thing.  Laird's a great healer
himself, you know&mdash;he's a marvel with the sick, and
the sorrowing, and the poor.  But I'm afraid he's
drifting&mdash;he began with Drummond, and ended with
Harnack."  I recognized the soporific name.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, there's another thing," resumed the
orthodox one; "Laird has doubts as to whether or not
sorrow comes from God.  Affliction, you know;
bereavement, suffering, the death of little
children&mdash;everything like that.  He's inclined, I'm afraid, to
attribute it to another source&mdash;doesn't seem to be clear
that it's God's will for us to suffer," and I could hear
the comfortable one settling back in the softly-cushioned
chair.  "Now, that never troubles me at all&mdash;I
always feel certain our sorest sorrows come from
God; was just saying so yesterday to a woman whose
little boy was drowned.  He was her only child."
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever lose a child?" the other minister
asked quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, I've never had any trouble of that kind,
thank God.  Ours are all well and strong.  By the
way, Forest, our train goes in a little over an hour.  I
suppose we'll have dinner before we go&mdash;it's tea here,
I believe, in the evening.  Doesn't suit me altogether,
either&mdash;I've had a new kind of life since I began
taking dinner in the evening," as he rose from his
chair and began to move restlessly about.
</p>

<p>
I glided away noiselessly like one in a dream.  My
heart was leaden, and I thought it was all for love of
Gordon and dread of what might thus befall him.  My
principal thought, as I remember, was of his relation
to his work&mdash;and his position&mdash;and his future.  Yet
I know now that what gave me the deepest pain was
a trembling fear lest those things should slip from
<i>me</i>&mdash;as from him&mdash;the things I reckoned the foundation
stones of the life that was so happy now.  Without
knowing it, ever since that night I saw Jennie die,
the secret between my heart and Christ had been
growing more rich and full.  I esteemed Him the
meeting-place whereon Gordon and I had found each
other; and I feared, though I could not have put it
into words, that distance from Him would mean
distance from each other.  Perhaps it was wrong;
perhaps these two passions of my heart should have been
reverently kept separate&mdash;but they were blended and
intertwined in a union that was altogether holy.
</p>

<p>
I kissed Harold gently as I bended over his bed
and tucked him in an hour later; he stirred in his
sleep as my hot tears fell upon his face.  Then I
knelt beside him&mdash;I remembered how my mother
used thus to kneel by me&mdash;and I prayed, pleadingly,
in the new-found way that had grown so dear.  My
pleading was all for Gordon, passionate in its
intercession, as though he were drifting out to sea, and
God alone could bring him back.
</p>

<p>
I was hardly risen from my knees when Gordon
came home.  He came at once to where I was; and
he smiled in that happy way he had, whenever he saw
me bending over Harold.  It always seemed to
delight him so.
</p>

<p>
"You're an idolater, Helen, aren't you?" he said.
</p>

<p>
I clung to him in a very spasm of fondness, as if he
were slipping from me.  My heart cried out in a wild,
hungry way, though my lips were still.  I wanted to
call him back, back to the shelter where our life's
happiness began.
</p>

<p>
"And I don't blame you, dear," he went musingly
on as he looked down on the rosy face; "life
is all preface till you have children, isn't it?&mdash;the real
volume comes after that."
</p>

<p>
"I could die for him," I said.  (This was with a
purpose.  I was trying, for the first time, a lesson in
theology.  It struck me with a kind of amusing pain,
my poor attempt to teach Gordon&mdash;Gordon so
learned, so clever.)
</p>

<p>
"So could I," he murmured.
</p>

<p>
"It makes me understand how&mdash;how One died for
us all," I faltered, coming to my point with desperate
directness.  How the angels must have smiled if they
heard my first attempt at preaching!  "It helps me
understand how love and suffering must go together&mdash;God
can't help it any more than we.  If I were a
preacher, Gordon, I'd preach that all the time."
</p>

<p>
He turned and looked at me in amazement.  Then
his arms went round me tight.  "Darling," he said
gently, "you're a lovely missionary&mdash;and I'm a
heathen; I'm an idolater&mdash;like you&mdash;only you're my
idol."
</p>

<p>
"But you believe that, don't you, Gordon?" I
urged, "that&mdash;what I said?  You do, don't you,
Gordon?"
</p>

<p>
His eyes studied my face, and so gravely, for a
moment.
</p>

<p>
"Is my wife growing alarmed about me too?" he
said, half seriously; "don't be uneasy, darling&mdash;your
husband's sound, all right.  Only I still plead guilty
to idolatry&mdash;kiss me, so I'll know you're human," he
concluded, laughing.
</p>

<p>
I kissed him, and more than once.  But my heart
ached on.
</p>

<br /><br />
<i>HAROLD'S SISTER&mdash;AND ANOTHER.</i>
</h3>

<p>
The next saddest thing to having no children
is having only one.  Parental sorrows
are to be classified as follows.  First, and
greatest, if you haven't any; second, if you have
only one.  For there is no loneliness like the forlornness
of a solitary bairn, to use a term of which Gordon
was very fond; born to play, yet having none to play
with; in need of chastening, yet denied the discipline
of other children; hungry for fellowship, yet starving
among its seniors.  There is no desert so waste and
weary as the Sahara that surrounds a solitary child.
</p>

<p>
Life has few moments of surpassing thrill and
wonder.  Yet there are some; and the loveliest thing
about it all is this, that wealth cannot buy them, nor
genius create them, nor rank command them.  The
impartialness of God is beautiful.  A few of the
superfluities do seem to be a little unevenly
distributed&mdash;but the great holy luxuries of life are as
freely vouchsafed the peasant as the king.  The glory
and the beauty of life itself; the shelter of a mother's
arms and the deeper shelter of her heart; the first
dismantling kiss of love; the earliest glimpse of your
first-born's face&mdash;these are for the ploughman as well
as the poet or the prince.
</p>

<p>
And there is another moment when life's so often
tawny tide glows with the very light of heaven.  It
came to me and Gordon the day he led little Harold
in, to look upon his sister's face.  Ah, me! the tears
start even yet when I recall the sacred scene.  I was
lying there, so weak, so happy.  The slumbering
babe lay beside me, gurgling now and then those
mysterious sounds that a mother's heart translates so
readily.  I heard them coming&mdash;Harold and his
father&mdash;the strong tread mingling musically with the
patter of the little feet.  Up the stairs they came,
hand in hand along the hall, little Harold puffing
with excitement, for he knew something wonderful
was to be revealed.  I raised my head and saw them
as they entered the room.
</p>

<p>
Oh, my son, my son! why did I not value more
those days of the dear childish face, as I saw it then?
Why did I not realize that the sterner days were
coming when those sweet features were to be buffeted
by sorrow and assailed by sin?  I see him now, the
little torn straw hat above the neglected locks&mdash;for
children <i>will</i> run to seed when the mother is
withdrawn&mdash;the plump, ruddy cheeks, all stained from the
sand pile on the lawn, the dampness on the little
forehead, the besmirched but becoming frock; and the
eyes, wonderful eyes, so sober, so inquisitive,
searching curiously for the unknown, breaking into shy
laughter as they fell on me; the pudgy hand, quickly
withdrawn from his father's; then the little frame, one
half-bare leg dangling in the air, lifted high as Gordon
held him up.  I feel again the tremble in my fingers
as I pulled back the shawl from about his sister's
head, and see again the long look of wonder as my
son gazed down upon the baby's face; I see the tiny
throat swallow once or twice as his emotion gathered,
and think of the vast realm in his heart that even his
father and I cannot explore.  Once again I see the
refusing nod&mdash;his golden curls shaken the
while&mdash;when I tell him to kiss his baby sister; his
brooding eyes turned to mine, the outstretched arms, the
rosy lips coming down to mine to be kissed; and I
catch the mist in Gordon's eyes, my own swimming
with tender joy, even as they are overflowing now so
that I can hardly see to write.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The years flew swiftly by, unmarked by incident
of note, but full of simple joy.  Harold was well on
his way in school&mdash;clever, like his father&mdash;and his
sister had left the days of babyhood behind, when a
new influence came into our quiet lives, a new Life
into our little circle.
</p>

<p>
It was our daughter's birthday night, and Gordon
had asked some friends to dinner.  For, as I should
have said before, he was simply crazy about Dorothy,
which was the name we had bestowed upon our
daughter&mdash;it had been my mother's.  Nobody need
tell me that a father's master passion is anything else
than his first-born girl.  Lots of men dissemble, I
know, and profess to hold all their children in equal
affection&mdash;but it's simply moonshine.  If I'm a
specialist in anything, it's children; and I have satisfied
myself over and over again that a father, nineteen
times out of twenty, is the bondsman of his eldest
daughter.  Dorothy looked like me; and I have a
theory, which some cleverer brain will have to work
out, that Gordon got her kind of mixed up with his
sweetheart feelings, and loved the me that was in
her, and the her that was in me.  Anyhow, he was
simply crazy about her, as I have said&mdash;and for years
I thought it quite unfair how he made Harold play
second fiddle for Her Majesty the Baby.  And yet,
strange though it sound, Harold was his very life&mdash;but
we shall hear of this before my tale is told.
</p>

<p>
Well, as I have reported, Gordon must have a
dinner party.  It was to be in honour of Dorothy's
original arrival, he said.  So we invited some of the
very nicest people in the church, some of the most
clever and refined, and some of the unspoiled rich.
(I believe the grand folks of St. Andrew's were coming
to think more of Gordon every day.) And I got
up the loveliest little dinner, with Harriet's aid of
course, for she was as proud of Dorothy as we were
ourselves.
</p>

<p>
The dinner was just in mid-career, and everything
was going splendidly, when all of a sudden Harriet
came to the dining-room door and beckoned to me.
I could see by her face that it was something important.
</p>

<p>
"There's an old man here," she said as the door
closed behind us, "and I thought I ought to call
you&mdash;he says he's related."
</p>

<p>
"Related!" I echoed, "related to whom?"
</p>

<p>
"To Dr. Laird, ma'am," Harriet answered.
</p>

<p>
I knew there must be some mistake, since Gordon's
relatives were all across the sea; besides, he had
hardly any that I knew of, except his father.
</p>

<p>
I hurried out to the kitchen.  As I entered, I saw
the figure of a man well advanced in years; tall he
was above the ordinary, but evidently stooped with
toil.  He rose from his chair as I approached, and
bowed with a kind of native grace.  Then he turned
his face to mine and looked me over with one of the
steadiest pairs of eyes that ever belonged to mortal.
They were deeply set, keen and bright; high cheek
bones on either side; ruddy complexion, significant
of health; great wavy folds of snowy hair fell almost
to his shoulders, those shoulders wrapped in a kind
of grayish plaid; flowing beard, white as the locks
above.  His nose was prominent and strong, the
mouth delicate, and firmly set, as though he had a
mind of his own and knew how to use it.  His
clothes were coarse and plain, such as I fancied were
worn by the peasants overseas; homespun stuff, I
saw; and a flannel shirt, partly open, disclosed a
sunburnt throat.  He came forward and held out his
hand, which I noticed was hard and rough, its clasp
firm and strong; the other hand held a long staff,
crooked at the top; a bundle, wrapped in a kind of
shawl, lay at his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Is this the guidwife o' the hoose?" he asked,
in a strong Scottish voice; "micht ye be Gordon's
wife?"
</p>

<p>
I acknowledged that I was, my tone indicating that
I wouldn't mind knowing who he was.
</p>

<p>
"I'm his faither," he said simply; "this'll be a
graun' surprise to Gordon.  Is he ben the hoose?"
indicating the dining-room by a nod of his head.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said&mdash;"I'll call him out," my eyes fixed
in a kind of fascination on the face and form before
me.  This was a new type to me; unfamiliar enough,
but decidedly picturesque withal.
</p>

<p>
"I wunner will he ken me?" the old man said, a
twinkle in his eye.  "It's mony a lang day sin' he
gaed awa'.  But he'll mebbe be busy?  Is there some
o' his congregation wi' him?" for he heard the sound
of voices.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," I said, "he can come all right&mdash;we're
just having dinner."
</p>

<p>
"Mercy on us!" cried the stranger, "but ye're late
wi' yir dinner; ha'e ye no' had onythin' sin'
breakfast?"
</p>

<p>
I smiled, turning towards the door to call my
husband.  But he had evidently heard our voices, or
something else had prompted him to come out, for
he was already on his way to the kitchen.  I stood
silent, and his eyes turned upon the stranger.  They
rested there, it seemed to me, a good half minute
before a sound escaped his lips.  Then with a loud cry
he leaped forward, holding out his arms.  The hunger
on the older face was pitiful to see.  Sometimes
clasping Gordon tight to his bosom, sometimes holding
him back a little to look upon his face, the father
heart seemed unable to drink its fill.
</p>

<p>
"Where did you come from, father?" Gordon
asked, when speech at length returned.
</p>

<p>
"I cam' frae Scotland&mdash;where else?" his father
answered, "richt frae the hills.  An' I didna' let ye
ken&mdash;I thocht 'twad be a bonnie surprise to ye.  I
landed at Montreal last nicht, an' then I cam' richt
on.  Whaur's the bairns?"
</p>

<p>
"They're inside," said Gordon; "you'll see them
in a minute."  Then followed a few minutes of swift
questioning and answering.  "But come on in with
us now," Gordon suddenly broke in, taking his
father's arm as he spoke, "come, till I introduce you
to my friends&mdash;come, Helen."
</p>

<p>
I slipped behind the older man; and then, in
Indian file, Gordon leading, we returned to our
wondering guests.  A fine procession, too, we must have
made; Gordon in his spotless evening dress, I in my
very finest&mdash;and between us, tall and stooped, his
white locks shaking as he walked, his eagle eye fixing
itself half defiantly and half appealingly upon the
upturned faces, stood Gordon's father in his homespun,
the Scotch shawl still about his shoulders, the
huge safety-pin that held it gleaming in the brilliant
light.
</p>

<p>
Gordon introduced him to every guest: "My
father," he said to each, and no one could fail to see
the radiance on his face.  Then the old man was
given a seat at Gordon's right, the arrears of dinner
were brought quickly in, and in a moment our new
visitor was the centre of attraction.  Before taking
his seat he stooped and kissed both the children,
looking at them earnestly, then at their father,
"The laddie's like yir mither, Gordon," he said, his
voice trembling a little; "aye, he's got Elsie's
mouth," wherewith he kissed him again, the lad
looking up in wonder.  "The wee lassie favours
yirsel', Mrs. Laird."
</p>

<p>
"My name's Helen," I said quietly.
</p>

<p>
The strong face glowed with pleasure; and I
could see what joy my amendment had given Gordon.
"The wee girl has yir ain bonnie face, Helen,"
he corrected, hesitating a little before he spoke my
name.
</p>

<p>
It's wonderful what homing instincts children
have!  For a few minutes later little Dorothy,
usually so shy, slipped out of her chair and stole over
beside her grandfather, looking wistfully up into his
face.  He took her on his knee, stroking her head
with beautiful tenderness.
</p>

<p>
His plate of soup was now before him, but still
Grandfather Laird did not begin.  Finally, in some
perplexity, he turned to Gordon.  "I'll tak' a wee
drappie speerits, Gordon, if you please; I maistly
tak's juist what ye'd notice afore supper&mdash;forbye, I'm
tired."
</p>

<p>
Gordon flushed, hesitating.  "We haven't such a
thing about the house, father&mdash;we really never keep
it," he began in some embarrassment.  "It isn't
much of a custom out here, father."
</p>

<p>
The old man sighed as he took up the snow-white
napkin beside his plate, pushing it a little farther
away lest it should get soiled.  "I'm dootin' this
country's no' juist what it's thocht to be.  The first
mon I clappit my eye on in Montreal, he was a
beggar, wi' a cup&mdash;an' I thocht everybody had plenty
siller in Canady.  An' noo it seems ye ha'ena' a
drappie aboot the hoose.  Weel, it's nae matter; I
can dae wantin' it.  But I'll no' begin wi'oot the
blessin'," he added gravely.  "Wull ye say it,
Gordon?" nodding to his reverend son.
</p>

<p>
"No, father&mdash;you say it yourself," replied Gordon,
bowing his head, in which he was speedily followed
by all of us.
</p>

<p>
Then the old man, his hands outstretched, began a
prayer of prodigious length.  Adoration, confession,
thanksgiving followed in regular order, the whole
enriched with many a Scriptural quotation.  I could
not see the faces of our guests, but I knew right well
how mystified they must be.
</p>

<p>
A little shy at first, dispensing diffident glances
around the company as they tried to engage him in
conversation, the patriarch soon began to feel with
what cordiality we all regarded him.  Wherewith he
grew more and more communicative, this being evidently
the occasion of his life; besides, and naturally
enough, his heart was full to overflowing.
</p>

<p>
"It's hard to tak' it in, laddie," he said once or
twice, laying down his knife and fork and turning
full round to gaze at Gordon; "to think we're baith
in Ameriky, and me in yir ain hoose&mdash;an' you sittin'
wi' yin o' thae claw-hammer jackets on ye, like the
gentry wear.  It seems but the ither day ye were a
wee bare-leggit laddie, helpin' yir faither mind the
sheep.  Ye was as gleg as a collie dog.  I didna'
think then, laddie, ye'd ever wag yir heid in a
pulpit&mdash;but the ways o' Providence is wunnerfu'," as
the honest eyes shone with pride and joy.
</p>

<p>
I saw one of our minor guests titter a little at this.
She looked at Gordon rather as if she were sorry for
him; fancied, no doubt, that he would be in sore
straits of embarrassment to have his peasant father
thus presented.  But I never was prouder of my
husband than I was that night.  I actually felt my
eyes grow dim more than once as I remarked the
deference with which Gordon treated his father, so
different though he was from what anybody would
have expected.  He seemed to delight to honour
him; and while I suppose it was only natural for him
to notice how far from cultured he was&mdash;reckoning
from our standards&mdash;yet I know he reverenced him
in his inmost heart for the unaffected goodness that
none could fail to recognize.
</p>

<p>
Somebody, taking advantage of a momentary
pause, asked the old man about his voyage.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," he began enthusiastically, and I knew by
his tone that he was off; "oh, we had a graun' time
a'thegither.  I cam' i' the second cabin, nae doot," he
went on without a particle of confusion, "for it didna'
cost as muckle as the ither way; but there was a
graun' lot o' passengers.  We didna' ha'e ower muckle
to eat, nae doot&mdash;but they gied us porridge morn an'
nicht, sae we was fine.  An' there was twa ministers
wi' us," he went on, warming to his theme, "an' they
preachit till us on the Sabbath day.  It's wunnerfu',
the difference there is in ministers.  Yin o' them
preachit in the mornin', an' the ither at nicht; the
yin i' the mornin' was a puir feckless body; his
sermon was a' aboot flowers, an' birds&mdash;an' the
rainbow," this last coming out contemptuously; "he said
a' thae things brocht us nearer God&mdash;did ye ever hear
sic' haverin'?  An' he said they a' taught us aboot
th' Almichty&mdash;an' them as loved them wud be saved!
I thocht mysel' wae, to ha'e to sit an' listen till him.
But the ither mon&mdash;wha preachit till us at nicht&mdash;he
had the root o' the matter in him, I tell ye.  He
preachit aboot sinners bein' turned intil hell&mdash;I ha'e
the heids and pertikklers," he suddenly exclaimed,
diving into a pocket for the same.  "Here's his pints;
first, naebody kens God wha doesna' ken the
doctrines; second, thae wha doesna' ken will be lost,"
the gray beard shaking solemnly as he rolled out the
truth; "third, them wha's lost is lost to a' eternity.
Oh, it was a graun' discoorse, I'm tellin' ye.  It was
unco' refreshing after the baby broth we got i' the
mornin'.  I pit tuppence in the plate&mdash;but I didna'
gie a farthin' in the mornin'.  Are thae folk a'
Presbyterians, Gordon?" he concluded by enquiring,
nodding towards the assembled visitors.
</p>

<p>
"Mostly all, father," was Gordon's answer; "in
fact, I believe they all are."
</p>

<p>
"Div ye teach them the Catechism, when ye're
visitin'?" the old man pursued.
</p>

<p>
"Not very much, I'm afraid," answered Gordon,
laughing; "you won't find things just the same here,
father, as they are in old Scotland&mdash;not in that line,
at least."
</p>

<p>
The old man's face clouded.  "Thae things
shouldna' change," he said solemnly; "sin doesna'
change&mdash;and the truth o' God's aye the same, my son,"
as he looked down at the table.  "I'm dootin' they're
ower anxious aboot makin' money.  They tell me
maist everybody's rich in Canady&mdash;but I saw twa
beggars in Montreal," he recalled a little ruefully.
Then suddenly:
</p>

<p>
"I ha'e a wee pickle siller wi' me mysel', Gordon,"
the Scotch instinct showing in his voice; "only it's
nae sae little!"
</p>

<p>
At this juncture my husband made heroic efforts to
change the subject; but the old Scotchman was as
intense about this as about graver matters.  "Aye, I
ha'e upwards o' a hunnerd pounds," he said impressively,
glancing shyly at the company; "ye mind yir
mither's Aunt Kirsty?&mdash;or mebbe ye never saw her?
Weel, onyway, she died.  An' she was lang aboot it,
I tell ye, for she was ninety-four.  Sae it was better
for her to gang&mdash;better for us baith&mdash;an' she willed
her wee bit belongings tae me&mdash;an' I sold them afore
I left.  An' yir faither was the prood mon at the
funeral, Gordon&mdash;I was the chief mourner," he
explained impressively; "I was the only yin there that
was related to the corpse&mdash;and I walked ahint the
bearers till the graveyard.  A' the folk said I carried
mysel' like a minister; the undertaker, he was an
awfu' solemn mon&mdash;but I was solemner nor him; an' I
kenned a' the time, mind ye, that I was the heir.
That's hoo I got the siller to pay my way to Canady.
But I ha'e a hunnerd pounds left, Gordon&mdash;an' I'm
gaein' to invest it, after I look aboot a wee bit.
Investments is awfu' profitable here, they tell me.
It'll mak' a cozy pickle o' siller for me, wull it no',
Gordon?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't count too much on it, father," Gordon
answered; "money isn't just as universal here as you
old-country people think."  But the old man seemed
reluctant to be convinced of this.
</p>

<p>
A little later in the evening we had some music.
Most of the songs, I fear, were of the rather sthetic
type; and I fancied they appealed but little to our
venerable friend.  He sat quietly in a corner of the
parlour, as if lost in thought.  Every now and then
his eyes would rove to Gordon's face, glowing with
pride and affection.  As for me, I knew not when I
had been so fascinated.  I simply sat and watched
him, hardly knowing just what it was that held me so.
Partly the picturesqueness of this rugged type, I
suppose, and partly a dawning recognition of the
sterling worth behind the stern exterior; genuineness was
written all over him.  Then I think I was beginning
to love him for my husband's sake&mdash;I remember how
the thought flashed on me that I never would have
had Gordon but for him.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, availing himself of a temporary lull, the
old man cleared his throat: "I'll gie ye a sang
mysel'," he offered; "nane o' yir highfalutin
kind&mdash;but a guid auld yin o' Bobbie Burns.  It
minds me o' yir mither, Gordon," as he cleared his
throat again with mighty din, preparatory to
performance.
</p>

<p>
"I'll try and play for you if you tell me what it is,
Mr. Laird," volunteered one of the ladies, moving
towards the piano.  I had seen grandfather eyeing her
askance a little while before; indeed, I myself thought
her evening dress was rather overdone about the
shoulders&mdash;underdone, perhaps, would be a better
word.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," replied the old man, with a disdainful
wave of his hand, "yon clatter wud only throw me
aff the tune.  I'll sing the way the Almichty meant,"
with which he broke into a strong, clear baritone that
would really have commanded attention in any company.
More inspiring still, the whole soul of the man
seemed to fuse with the touching words:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "My Mary's asleep by thy murmuring stream;<br />
  Flow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The applause that greeted the performance seemed to
please the old man well.  From many standpoints
this was evidently the night of his life, and soon his
enthusiasm knew no bounds.  Not more than half
an hour after, this first ovation still lingering
gratefully in the performer's mind, one or two of the
guests suggested that he favour us with another
Scotch song, a proposal that soon grew into a general
demand.
</p>

<p>
"I canna'," declined the old man, "I canna' juist the
noo.  But I'll tell ye what I'll dae wi' ye.  I'll gie ye
the Hielan' fling&mdash;that's fair graun', an' ye'll no' hae
it in Canady.  Gordon, gie me the bootjack, like a
guid laddie&mdash;my shoon's ower heavy for dancin'&mdash;they're
the lang-toppit kind."
</p>

<p>
"We've nothing of the sort, father," Gordon
explained reluctantly.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, weel," he answered cheerfully, "ye'll
dae fine yirsel'.  Staun' aroon' wi' yir back till
me&mdash;and let yon mon pit his back till ye,"
indicating an immaculate professor of burly form;
who, apprehending, presented himself for Gordon's
grasp, the latter in turn taking the already
extended foot between his legs and gripping the boot
tightly with his hands.  Gordon's sire then lifted
up the free foot upon his son, pushing mightily,
and making a noise the while such as I have heard men
employ when raising telegraph poles.  A moment
later Gordon and the professor were in a heap on the
floor, a long boot with a red top between them.  The
second similarly removed, the old man moved
solemnly out to the middle of the floor, called for a
couple of walking sticks, laid them crosswise; then
broke into the most fantastic dance, leaping to and
fro above the imaginary swords, sometimes crouching
low, sometimes springing high in air, sometimes
whirling like a Dervish with outflowing arms, the whole
enriched by an occasional savage yell that was first the
terror, afterwards the delight, of one or two of the
ladies.  But all were entranced, and none more so
than the performer himself.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after the excitement had subsided the
guests began to make their farewells.  But this struck
the venerable Scotchman as quite irregular.  "Hoots!"
he cried, when one or two had proffered me their
hands, "ye canna' gang till we've had worship;
Gordon wadna' like it.  Wha ever heard tell o' freens
leavin' the manse wi'oot a word o' prayer?  Gordon,
tak' the Buik"; and his son, an amused smile playing
about his lips, proceeded promptly to do as he was
told.
</p>

<p>
"Are ye no' gaein' to sing?" the old man suddenly
broke out, for Gordon was just starting to read.
</p>

<p>
"We don't usually, father; it's not customary here,"
was the answer.
</p>

<p>
"It's a sair custom," rejoined his father, "neglectin'
to sing the praise o' Almichty God.  But, onyway,
we'll ha'e a psalm&mdash;I'll raise the tune mysel',"
which purpose he carried into effect as soon as a
selection had been made.  "We'll tak' the eighty-ninth,"
he said presently; and as he launched the
mighty strain I recognized the very words that had
given me my first introduction to the psalms, that
far-gone night in uncle's house:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Oh, greatly blessed the people are<br />
  The joyful sound that know,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
he began, singing onward to the end.  Gordon and I
alone could join with him, but our leader seemed not
to care.  His whole heart and mind were absorbed
in the great song of his fatherland, and he sang it as
only an exile can.  Face and voice and soul all seemed
to bear witness to the truth of the noble verse which
brought the psalm to an end.  He looked like one of
the old battling Covenanters themselves, his eyes
closed, his head thrown back, one hand gently
keeping time as he rolled out the crowning stanza:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "For God is our defense and He<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To us doth safety bring;<br />
  The Holy One of Israel<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is our Almighty King."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Silence fell.  Then Gordon moved over under the
light and began to read the Scriptures.  The passage
he chose was that sublime chapter from Isaiah; and
there were few could interpret through the voice as
Gordon could.  The old man sat, his eyes shaded by
his hand, listening reverently.  By and by Gordon
came to the words: "My servant shall deal prudently
... he shall be exalted and extolled ... his
visage was so marred more than any man and
his form more than the sons of men."
</p>

<p>
"Expound yon," came as a sudden interruption.
</p>

<p>
Gordon looked up from the book.  "What's that,
father?  Do what?"
</p>

<p>
"Expound the Word," his father repeated solemnly;
"the minister should aye expound the passage.  Tell
the folk wha the prophet means."
</p>

<p>
Gordon turned a puzzled look on the page.
</p>

<p>
"Yon aboot the servant," his father explained;
"the Suffering Servant, ye ken&mdash;Him wha's face was
marred wi' cruel men.  Ye ken wha the prophet's
referrin' to, my son?"
</p>

<p>
Gordon understood.  "I see what you mean," he
answered slowly; "but I don't know that I'm quite
clear about that myself.  The best scholarship seems
in doubt as to whether&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But the old man was all on fire now.  "I dinna'
ken naethin' aboot yir scholars," he broke in
vehemently, "an' I dinna' care.  But yon bit refers to
the Man o' Sorrows&mdash;ye ken that fine, div ye no'?&mdash;it's
Christ the prophet means&mdash;an' Him sufferin' for
sin.  Gordon, expound the Word," and there was a
stern grandeur about the pose and the voice of this
champion of the truth that would have done credit
to the ancient prophet himself.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot," said Gordon, his lips quite white;
"not as you understand it, father&mdash;it isn't clear to me."
</p>

<p>
"Then close the Buik," said the old man sternly;
"if it's no' the savour of life unto life, it'll be the
savour o' death unto death."
</p>

<p>
And Gordon did.  "You'll lead us in prayer,
father," he said, his voice so low we could hardly
hear.
</p>

<p>
His father seemed to hesitate a moment, looking
timidly around upon the strangers.  Then he slowly
sank on his knees beside the chair, one hand resting
on Dorothy's golden curls; and in a moment the
Presence seemed about us.  It was a wonderful
prayer, and came as if out-breathed beneath the very
shadow of the Cross.
</p>

<p>
Our guests took their leave in silence.  After the
children were tucked away I waited long up-stairs for
Gordon; but I fell asleep at last, the sound of earnest
voices still floating upward from the study.  I knew
it was a collision of the old school and the new&mdash;and
I prayed on the father's side.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap21"></a></p>

<h3>
XXI
<br /><br />
<i>"LOVE'S OLD SWEET SONG"</i>
</h3>

<p>
There could be but one end to this.
Whether Gordon was right or wrong, he
was not at one with the standards of his
church.  I really believe, although I shrink from
saying it, that his idea of <i>saving</i> men came more and
more to be confused with the process of simply
<i>helping</i> them.  This sprang partly, of course, from
his nobility of nature, from his large and loving
heart&mdash;but it was wrong.  Gordon, I think, believed
in relieving men, then reforming them, both of which
were to spell regeneration.  And then, besides, he
seemed to have adopted some theory about law, and
the laws of nature&mdash;he knew more about evolution
than any other man since Darwin&mdash;that had turned
the once sweet luxury of prayer, real prayer, into
nothing more than a sort of religious exercise.  I
don't believe he thought prayers that actually asked
for things were of any use at all.
</p>

<p>
I suppose, too, although I never could find out
much about this, that Gordon didn't just regard the
Scriptures in the same way his brother ministers did;
yet I knew he reverenced the Bible and simply lived
among its teachings.
</p>

<p>
But there could, as I have said, be only one end to
all of this&mdash;so far, I mean, as Gordon's relation to
St. Andrew's was concerned.  I felt from the beginning
that it would be but a matter of time till he must
forsake the pulpit he loved so well.  There were two
influences that contributed powerfully to this: the
one was Gordon's honour&mdash;the other, Gordon's father.
My husband had a fastidious conscience&mdash;and a faithful sire.
</p>

<p>
Grandfather had been with us long&mdash;I cannot say
exactly how long&mdash;before matters actually came to a
crisis.  But I think he felt from the beginning, with
the keen instinct of his kind, that Gordon's official
ministry was at an end.  One night, sitting in an
adjoining room, I overheard the most of a long
conversation between the father and the son.  The
burden of it did not greatly surprise me; grandfather
had given me his mind on the matter before, or
implied it anyhow, and more than once.  But I knew
that night that the crisis was at hand.
</p>

<p>
"Ye canna' dae onythin' else," the old man repeated
once or twice; "when a minister gi'es up the
fundamentals, it's no' richt for him to keep his kirk.
A preacher wi'oot a gospel!&mdash;he's a sair objec'," the
Scotch voice concluded pitifully.
</p>

<p>
I could catch the tone of almost bitter remonstrance
in Gordon's answer.  "Without a gospel, father!"
he cried reproachfully; "surely you don't accuse me
of that&mdash;surely you're going too far."
</p>

<p>
"Ye dinna' believe Christ died for sinners," the
older man said sternly; "an' ony minister wha doesna'
believe that&mdash;he's wi'oot a gospel, my son."
</p>

<p>
"You don't understand me, father," Gordon
remonstrated earnestly; "you state the thing too
severely&mdash;perhaps I don't just believe it in the way
you do, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There's only the yin way to believe yon,"
interrupted his father; "you an' me's the same kind o'
sinners, my son&mdash;an' we need the same kind o' a
Saviour.  Forbye, ye think we're a' divine, I'm
dootin'; that's what they say aboot ye, onyway&mdash;an'
I'm thinkin' I've gathered it from yir sermons mair
nor once."
</p>

<p>
"Not exactly, father," I heard Gordon answer.
"What I do teach is, that every man has the divine
within him; and if we but appeal&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I dinna' ken what ye've got inside o' ye," broke
in the champion of truth, "but I'm sick an' tired
o' all inside o' <i>me</i>&mdash;naethin' but sin an'
misery&mdash;naethin' but filthy rags," he added, careless of the
unseemly metaphor.  "An' there's mair&mdash;ye dinna'
believe there's ony use in prayer; nae guid ava',
forbye juist ha'ein' fellowship wi' God.  An' ye dinna'
believe there's ony use in prayin' for the things we
want&mdash;ye dinna' think it maks ony difference; ye're
feart o' the laws of natur'&mdash;ye think God's a servant
in His ain hoose, like as if He couldna' dae onythin'
He wants to dae."
</p>

<p>
"But I do believe in prayer, father&mdash;of course I
do.  Perhaps I don't just believe that it alters or
affects the outward course of things; but at the same
time&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then ye maun settle it wi' the Word of God,"
the old man answered solemnly; "it aye bids us to
ask for what we want; an' it tells us God's oor
Heavenly Faither&mdash;an' what for wud He no' dae
things for us, Him, wi' all power in His hands.  Oh,
my son, my son, ye'll change yir mind some day,
I'm dootin', when yir sair heart's callin' oot for the
love o' the livin' God."
</p>

<p>
And thus the sorrowful dialogue made its way.
</p>

<p>
I think it was the very next day Gordon told me
he had resigned St. Andrew's.  He told me his
reason, too; which I knew already.  My heart leaped
towards the children, I remember, but I scarce knew
why; tenderly, passionately, pityingly, my heart
went out to my children, to whom I knew it would
mean the most.
</p>

<p>
"Where will we go to live?" was one of the first
questions I asked.  For I did not seek, then, to turn
Gordon from his purpose.  I knew too well how
impossible that would be; besides, I felt no honourable
course was open to him but the one he had already
chosen.
</p>

<p>
Gordon's face was very grave as he began to tell
me of the only opening he saw before him.
</p>

<p>
"But you'll get another call, Gordon&mdash;and another
church, won't you?" I asked, dimly fearing.
</p>

<p>
"No, no other call&mdash;and no other church," he
answered firmly; "at least, no regular church, Helen;"
with which he explained to me how the very reasons
that prompted him to renounce St. Andrew's must
hold him back from any similar position.  "But I'll
have a field of work just the same&mdash;of usefulness,
too, please God," he added, in the lowest voice.  "I
can labour there without being responsible to any
one but Him."
</p>

<p>
Then he told me all about the plan he had in view.
He would take the little mission in Swan Hollow;
this was the sunken part of the city in which he had
so long carried on the work that had received so
much of his care and love&mdash;the same to which Jennie
McMillan had belonged, to whom I owed the happiness
of all the years between.
</p>

<p>
"We've got a little church there," he said, a note
of pride mingling with the sadness of his voice, "and
it doesn't belong to anybody but ourselves.  The
people built it&mdash;and I helped them.  It's just
possible the Presbytery may try to interfere with
me&mdash;but I don't think so.  That's where I'm going to
preach now, Helen; and I'll preach the truth as I
believe it."
</p>

<p>
"But, Gordon," I remonstrated, "won't it be the
same truth that you've preached in St. Andrew's?"
</p>

<p>
He did not answer immediately.  And his face
was clouded when his words came at length.  "It
won't be the same as St. Andrew's expects to hear&mdash;and
wants to hear," he said; "they demand the old
orthodox truths in the old orthodox way&mdash;and then
they're through with them," he added a little
bitterly; "till the next Sunday, at least."
</p>

<p>
"But aren't those the same truths your father
believes?" I pressed, feeling the strength of my reply.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he answered, "but my father believes them
in his inmost heart&mdash;and he lives them."
</p>

<p>
"And don't you believe them in your inmost
heart, Gordon?" I cried eagerly&mdash;"the way your
father does?"
</p>

<p>
"No," he answered gravely, after a long pause, his
face very white; "no, I don't believe them as my
father does."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Gordon," I pleaded with sudden entreaty,
"come back&mdash;come back, my darling.  You're drifting;
oh, Gordon, you're drifting away from God&mdash;and
me," for my soul's loneliness was about me like
a mist.
</p>

<p>
"Don't," he said huskily, holding out his arms to
me, "for God's sake don't make it any harder for me.
No man can drift far if he tries to do good in his
Master's name&mdash;and I intend, I honestly purpose, to
give my life to those poor people at the mission.  If
any man will do His will, we're told, he shall know
the doctrine.  I'm going to try to do His will,
Helen&mdash;and I want you close beside me, together, doing
our life-work hand in hand.  Then we can't be
anything but happy, my darling," and his words rang
with the note of life and courage.
</p>

<p>
I loved the people of the mission; and I loved the
work.  But the import of it all rose before me for a
moment like a sullen cloud; the squalor of the
homes; the ignorance of the people, loving and
grateful though they were; the poverty on every
hand; the obscurity of the position that must be
ours; the pitiful support that we could hope to
receive.  And our cozy manse seemed to grow and
dance before my eyes, clothed suddenly with palatial
beauty.  I could see little Dorothy, the big sunbonnet
shading the dimpled face, as she picked
dandelions on the lawn; and Harold, the treasure of
my heart, as he swung into the hall and flung his
school-bag on the table, calling aloud the while for
mother.  It is humiliating to write it down; but I
think the question of our living, too, of simple bread
and butter, actually presented itself to my saddened
and bewildered mind.
</p>

<p>
I suppose it was weak and selfish of me&mdash;though I
cared not for myself&mdash;when I flung myself into
Gordon's arms and besought him as I did.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Gordon," I pleaded amid my tears; "don't,
dearest, for the children's sakes.  It isn't too late yet,
Gordon&mdash;have you thought of what this means?&mdash;we'll
likely have to take Harold out of school."
</p>

<p>
He caressed me, trying to soothe me as he might
a child.  "I know what it means, Helen," he
answered; "I've thought of all that.  It breaks my
heart to think of what it will bring to you&mdash;but I am
helpless, dear, I'm helpless."
</p>

<p>
"Not me," I sobbed, "not me, Gordon; I'd go
with you to the depths of Africa.  But the children,
Gordon&mdash;think of them.  We're old," I cried&mdash;and I
really believed it&mdash;"we're old, and our life is nearly
done; but Harold and Dorothy are so young, and
theirs is all before them.  And don't&mdash;oh, Gordon,
don't&mdash;for our children's sakes."
</p>

<p>
"What can I do, my child?" he murmured.
"What else can I do?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, Gordon&mdash;do what I do.  Oh, Gordon, all
you need to do is to believe those things&mdash;the things
I do, and the things your father does&mdash;and preach them,
like you used to at the first.  And then we won't
need to go away at all.  I believe the people really
love you more now than they did years ago&mdash;and
they'll keep on loving you&mdash;and then we won't have
to, have to give up all this," I concluded, my
tear-dim eyes looking wistfully up into his tired face.
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.  "I must follow what light I
have," he said.
</p>

<p>
"But, Gordon," I went on, still hoping against
hope, "I'm sure it would come all right.  We'll
study those things out together, dear&mdash;and I'll help
you.  I've learned a lot about them, ever since that
night&mdash;that night, you remember, when Jennie died.
And I'll try and explain everything," I pleaded
pitifully, the pathos of it all coming over me as I looked
up at the strong and intellectual face, "and we'll
both go on together&mdash;in the old paths&mdash;and I'll try
so hard to help you, dear.  Then we won't have to
go away at all&mdash;or give up our house&mdash;and it's all so
dark ahead of us, for the children, I mean."
</p>

<p>
"I can't sell my soul for bread, Helen," he
answered solemnly; "and I know as well as you what
it all means.  My father's heart is nearly broken
now."
</p>

<p>
"And, Gordon," I whispered, still pressing my
poor plea, "there's another thing we'll do," as I drew
his face down beside my lips.
</p>

<p>
"What, dearest?"
</p>

<p>
"We'll&mdash;we'll pray together, Gordon; every day,"
I faltered, "every day, that God will make us
believe the right things.  And He will&mdash;I know He
will."
</p>

<p>
"I've prayed that for long," he murmured low.
"Oh, my darling, I love you so," and his lips pressed
themselves to mine with a reverence and a passion I
had never felt before.
</p>

<p class="thought">
******
<br />
</p>

<p>
Let me write it down, for the comfort of every
troubled heart, that the holiest hours in all life's
retrospect are those that are clothed in sorrow.  The
years have fled; yet the years are with me still.  And
when one sits in the gloaming (as I sit now) and
looks back at all the distant days, the lure that casts
its spell upon the heart comes not from the radiant
hour of mirth or ecstasy; nor from the period of
glad prosperity; nor from the season of echoing
mirth and laughter.  Not there does Memory ask
leave to linger.  But it hovers long, in sweet and
heartful reverie, about some hour of tender grief,
some season of blessed pain&mdash;blessed always, tender
evermore, because it has been glorified by love,
robbed of all its bitterness by the loyalty of some
dear heart that came closer and closer to your own
amid the darkness.
</p>

<p>
The home of early married life is the heart's
earthly home forever.  I knew that now; and memory
bathes the soul in tears as I recall our last night
beneath the roof of that St. Andrew's manse.
Everything was packed and ready.  The new house, the
tiny, shabby house that was next day to become our
home, was waiting for our advent.  The rude but
loving hands of some of the helpers at the mission
had joined with ours to make it ready.  And for our
living there, they were providing us with a little
salary; pitifully small&mdash;but our children would have
clothes and bread.
</p>

<p>
My heart was like to break; but we spent that last
evening in unconquerable brightness.  I know I was
no less cheerful than Gordon&mdash;and ever and anon I
wondered if his heart were as sad as mine.  The most
pitiful feature of it all was Dorothy's unconscious
glee&mdash;moving was such great fun, she thought.  Harold
was old enough to catch the contagion of our
pain&mdash;for pain will show through the best veneer that
courage can provide.
</p>

<p>
Both the children, and their grandfather too, were
in bed and sound asleep when Gordon and I went
up-stairs together about ten o'clock.  We went into
the children's room, for they were still unparted, the
little bed nestling close to the big one; and we stood
long above the slumbering forms, our eyes swimming
as we looked.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if it's really so," I heard Gordon murmur.
</p>

<p>
"What, darling?" I said.
</p>

<p>
"That God pities us&mdash;like we pity them," the
sentence finished in a broken voice.  "It solves all
life's problems&mdash;if that's really so."
</p>

<p>
I could make no answer.  But I bowed and kissed
Harold's lovely brow; then Dorothy's.
</p>

<p>
"Come with me, Gordon," I said gently, after we
had stood a while in silence, starting to move across
the hall.
</p>

<p>
He followed me into our own room.  "This is
harder than all the rest," I said brokenly; "this is the
dearest and sacredest room in the world to me.  Oh,
Gordon," and I was sobbing now, "surely they'll let
me&mdash;whoever comes here after us&mdash;surely they'll let
me come sometimes and see it, won't they, Gordon?"
</p>

<p>
His arms were so strong, his voice so tender.
"Why, dearest, why?  What makes this room so
sacred to you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't you know?" and the words could
hardly come for sobbing; "this is where they were
born, Gordon&mdash;where they both were born.  It was
right there I lay when I first saw Harold's face.
Oh, Gordon, I can't&mdash;I don't know how to give it up."
</p>

<p>
His eyes were full of pity and his voice was
quivering.  "Yes," he said, "yes, it's holy&mdash;but we
have the children left, my darling," and he began to
lead me gently from the room.  Nor did he stop till
we were standing where we had stood before,
looking down on the unconscious forms.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going down to the study for a while," he
said a little later; "I won't be long," as he began to
descend the stairs, his footsteps echoing through the
dismantled house.
</p>

<p>
I went back to my room, weeping, and sat down
upon one of the trunks that stood about.  Suddenly
an impulse came to me&mdash;I think it must have been
from heaven&mdash;and I sprang to my feet, burrowing
eagerly towards the bottom of the trunk.
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes later I stole down the stairs.  I was
arrayed in my wedding gown.  The years may have
chafed it some, but they had not availed against
its beauty and its richness.  The pearl trimming&mdash;and
those other radiant things that have no name&mdash;shone
triumphant in the light.  And I had about
my neck, and on my bosom, some precious lace
that I had removed long years before.  The hall
was almost empty&mdash;little there but our piano, that
had been dragged out and left close beside the
door.  There was a mirror, too, still undisturbed
upon the wall; and I paused before it just as I had
done that golden day in Baltimore when Gordon
was waiting to take me as his own forever.  My eyes
rested lovingly on the sweet and stainless vesture&mdash;it
still fitted me like a glove, thank heaven&mdash;and
then wandered to the face above.  Long, long I
gazed into the answering eyes, the past lying deep
within them like water in some amber spring.  The
face was older, of course, and the signs of toil and
care were on it; but the golden glow of love, I felt,
clothed it with a peace&mdash;and a beauty too&mdash;which
it never knew on that far-off wedding day.  Poverty
and hardship, I knew, were waiting at the gate;
obscurity and struggle were to be our portion.  But
my husband was sitting in the room just beyond the
door; my children&mdash;oh, the wealth and sweetness of
the word!&mdash;my children's breathing I could almost
hear; the years were past and gone, from whose
hands I had received them all&mdash;and in that hour my
wedding robes glistened with a holier light than
time can cast, and the bridal bliss sprang like a
fountain in my heart.
</p>

<p>
"Why so long?" Gordon suddenly sang out; "come in."
</p>

<p>
"I'm coming, dear," I said, and I felt the blitheness
of my voice as it echoed through the hall.  Very
softly I stepped in and stood before him as he sat
beside the dying fire.
</p>

<p>
His eyes devoured me with love; they roamed
mostly about my dress&mdash;which was exactly what I
wanted.  I think he glanced once or twice about the
room, its denuded bareness contrasting strangely
with the rich robe I wore.  Then he rose and took
me into his arms&mdash;far, deep in&mdash;as into a mighty
refuge.  "You never looked so sweet, my darling&mdash;the
years haven't touched it," was all he said.  But
he kissed my hair, my neck, my lips.
</p>

<p>
It was nearly an hour later when we arose to go
up-stairs, and I was still in all my glory as we moved
out, Gordon's arm still about me, into the echoing
hall.
</p>

<p>
"Sing something," he suddenly requested as we
passed the piano.  It stood in sullen silence, as if it
knew this to be a move for the worse.
</p>

<p>
My hands roved over the keys for a little; it was
hard to know what would suit the hour.
</p>

<p>
But some breath of other days was wafted in upon
me; and I felt my heart leap beneath the wedding
lace upon my bosom as the song gushed into my
mind again.
</p>

<p>
The light was dim, the house disrobed, the piano
out of tune.  But I can still see the rapture in
Gordon's face as mine turned up to meet it while the
words came one by one:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Still must you call me tender names<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still gently stroke my tresses;<br />
  Still shall my happy answering heart<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep time to your caresses."<br />
</p>

<br /><br />
<i>WHEN JOY AND SORROW MEET</i>
</h3>

<p>
"No, I'm never going back again," and the
stamp of determination was on Harold's
face as he spoke the words; "I'm never
going back to school any more."  He was gravely
adjusting his books in the well-worn bag as he spoke,
giving each one a final pat as if in last farewell.
"I've been there too long," as he looked up at his
father and me.
</p>

<p>
The room was small, the furniture shabby and
worn now; for some years had passed since we came
to live in the little house that still preserved to us an
unbroken circle.  We were all seated around the table
in the dining-room&mdash;which was our only living-room&mdash;and
Gordon had been telling Dorothy some wonderful
story of red Indians when Harold's avowal had
suddenly transfixed us all.
</p>

<p>
It is wonderful how a sudden wave of emotion
gives prominence, in the memory, to everything
connected with it.  I could draw, even now, as accurate
a picture of all the surroundings as though the event
were but of yesterday.  The room was small, as
already described; but so was the house, for that
matter.  Yet there was something sweet and lovely, to
me at least, about this tiny room that night&mdash;for my
loved ones were all within it.  I was sewing at the
time, mending, of which there seemed to be no end;
but every now and then my eyes would refresh
themselves upon the little group.  Gordon was still,
despite the years, by far the handsomest of them all.
The tokens of toil and care were not to be denied,
but a deeper calm and sweetness could be seen upon
the noble face as he bended over the golden locks of
our little daughter.  And very winsome was little
Dorothy, laughing up into her father's eyes, reading
there, as children are not slow to do, the signs of a
consuming love.  Grandfather Laird was dozing in
the big armchair in the corner, his hand still resting
on his shepherd's staff; dear old grandfather, whose
race was nearly run, the strong Scottish face stamped
more and more with the simple grandeur of his
nature as he came nearer to the eternal verities on
which his mind had dwelt so long.
</p>

<p>
I think my heart had gone out increasingly to
grandfather as the years went by.  Denied my own
immediate circle in my girlhood's home, my
affections had struck deep root amid all that Gordon
loved.  Perhaps I ought to say here that Gordon
more than once had wanted me to go South again&mdash;and
he would even have accompanied me.  But I always
felt it was too late, after my mother had entered
into rest&mdash;besides, there always yawned before me the
gulf that still lay between my uncle and my husband.
</p>

<p>
In addition to all this, to tell the honest truth, I
don't know how we could have devised ways and
means, even if I had been willing to visit my dear
Southland again.  For nobody will ever know the
bitterness of the struggle that we entered upon with
our departure from St. Andrew's.  The pinching and
paring and piteous penury that came with our change
of lot lingers with me yet as a troubled dream.  Yet
I want to say, in case this story should ever see the
light and anybody recognize its hero, that I never
heard a word of complaint from Gordon's lips.  If I
loved him before I almost worshipped him now.
With utter abandonment of devotion he gave himself
to the struggling and sinful people of the needy
quarter in which we made our home and among whom
we found our work.  All his buoyant vigour, his
splendid intellect, his glorious heart, were given
unreservedly to his lowly toil.
</p>

<p>
And I think I can say, with all regard to modesty,
that I honestly tried to help him.  His people grew
as dear to me, I verily believe, as they were to him.
Of course, my work was largely in our humble home,
which I tried to make as bright and comfortable for
Gordon as I could.  The children, too, filled my life
with busy joy&mdash;but I gave every hour I could spare,
and all the strength I could command, to help
Gordon in his noble drudgery.
</p>

<p>
I hardly know what I would have done, through all
those trying days, if it had not been for grandfather.
For one thing, his influence over Harold, now in the
perilous paths of youth, filled my heart with thankful
gladness.  His devotion to his grandson became the
passion of his life; he seemed unhappy if Harold was
out of his sight, and the boy's future was his
absorbing thought.
</p>

<p>
Then, besides, grandfather's life was so full of
Christian peace; and his faith, in spite of the awful
disappointment that Gordon's course had brought
him, remained true and tranquil through it all.  I
really think he was the best Christian I ever knew.
And how he comforted me, no one will ever know
till all such secrets be revealed.  For ours was a
common sorrow.  Soon it became evident to us both
that Gordon, nobly devoted though he was, was turning
more and more from the old truths that his father
held so dear.  Nor were they, I think, less precious
to myself; the deeper the darkness grew, and the
more Gordon seemed to turn from the truths that
had blessed my life, the more my troubled heart
seemed to find its refuge in the great realities of a
Divine Saviour, and an atoning Lord, and a Heavenly
Father who answers prayer; and I always found
grandfather's sorrowing spirit seeking the same
solace as my own.
</p>

<p>
I see them all again as they sat that night about
the table; the quick motion of Gordon's head is vivid
to me now, as he turned from the clamorous Dorothy
and gave all his attention to his son.
</p>

<p>
"I've been at school too long," Harold repeated
firmly, "and now I'm going to do something&mdash;to
earn my own living."
</p>

<p>
"What makes you say that, my son?" Gordon
asked, the pallor on his face betraying his emotion.
</p>

<p>
"Because I've found out all about it," Harold
replied confidently; "surely you don't think I'm such
a stupid as not to see all it has meant to you and
mother&mdash;all the sacrifice, I mean&mdash;and all the
struggle you've had to keep me going&mdash;and all the things
you've had to give up.  I know how poor we are,"
he went on passionately, "and I should have stopped
long ago, and tried to help instead of being a burden
to you."  Then he quoted one or two of his proofs,
which simple womanly pride forbids me to record;
but they were true enough, and it nearly broke my
heart to see the sadness on Gordon's face.  For there
was almost nothing he could say, and his poor
remonstrances were of no avail.
</p>

<p>
"Look at mother," Harold broke out vehemently;
"look at mother's dress.  It's the same one she's had
for years&mdash;and it's mended," he added in fiery
sadness, "and it's the only one she has in the world
except just one for Sundays&mdash;and it's shabby, too.  And
that's all for me, for me and Dorothy&mdash;but especially
for me&mdash;and I'm not going to stand it any longer.
Besides, I've got a place&mdash;and I'm going to begin
on Monday.  I'm going away to Carletonville.  But
I'll be home for Christmas," the fiery tone melting
into tenderness as he rose from his seat and came
over beside me.
</p>

<p>
For he had caught the expression of my face.  Ah
me! there are few moments in a woman's life like to
that which announces the outgoing of her child from
her home, how humble soever that home may be,
Especially if the outgoing one be her first-born son!
It was as if a knife had gone through my heart.
</p>

<p>
"But, what are you going to do, my boy?&mdash;what
kind of work, I mean?" I asked in a trembling
voice, the garment I was mending falling unheeded
to the floor.
</p>

<p>
"It's a bank," he answered proudly; "Mr. Duncan
got me in.  I didn't say anything to anybody till I got
it settled.  But I wrote the application myself&mdash;and
they said it was the best letter they ever got from an
applicant," a slight flush of pride on the boyish face.
"And Mr. Duncan says there's other work I can get
to do&mdash;at nights&mdash;and I'll be able to support myself
from the start," his breath coming fast with growing
excitement as he turned his eyes first on his father
and then on me.
</p>

<p>
"You shan't," I cried, with sudden fear, as it
broke on me that he was actually going away.  Our
poverty was as nothing then.  "Oh, Harold, you
mustn't&mdash;I cannot let you go," and I clung to him as
though he were going away that selfsame hour.
</p>

<p>
Gordon seemed unable to speak, sitting still and
staring at the boy.  Harold's cheeks were glowing
and his eyes were sparkling; his arm was still about
me.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly my husband found a voice, breaking out
into a torrent of remonstrance.  Really, it was quite
unlike him to grow so agitated&mdash;but Gordon's whole
life was in his children.  "If your mother and I can
stand it, there's no reason why you should object," he
pleaded, after many other arguments had been pressed
in vain.  But Harold was immovable; his word had
been passed, he said, and he would not recede
from it.
</p>

<p>
"Let the laddie gang," came suddenly from grandfather's
chair in the corner.  I think we had forgotten
he was there.  "It's the auld way o' the world&mdash;the
bairnies must leave the nest some time," he added, his
own voice shaking.  "An' his faither's God wull ha'e
him in His guid an' holy keeping&mdash;the Almichty'll
find the path for him.  Come here, my laddie," and
he held out his arms.  Harold came over, wondering;
the patriarch laid his hands in blessing on his head,
and then committed him to God in words of such
beauty as I think I never heard before.
</p>

<p>
But Gordon protested long and earnestly.  "Anything
but the bank," he said at last; "I cannot bear,
my son, to think of you in a bank."
</p>

<p>
"That's what I think," I cried, eagerly seconding;
"they make them work so hard&mdash;and it's all indoors&mdash;and
Harold's not overly strong," I pleaded, careless of
the splendid form that stood beside grandfather's chair.
</p>

<p>
"That has nothing to do with it," Gordon interrupted
in his abrupt way; "it's not of that I'm thinking
at all.  It's the peril of the thing, my son&mdash;the
danger, the temptations&mdash;just to think of the money
that passes through a lad's hands when he's put into
a bank.  And that's how so many of them are
ruined&mdash;for time and eternity," he added solemnly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Gordon," I cried in protest, "you don't mean
stealing, Gordon, stealing money&mdash;you don't mean
that?"
</p>

<p>
"That's exactly what I mean," said Gordon, untrained
to subterfuge.  "I mean the peril of handling
so much money."
</p>

<p>
Whereat I fell into a storm of dissent, half in
excitement, half in anger, as though my son had been
accused already.  I fear I spoke words harsh and
unreasonable, but my defense must be that I was all
unstrung with sudden grief and fear.  Till by and by
I was as violent in my demand for his father's consent
as I had been in denial of my own, so strange are the
cross-currents that trouble a woman's heart.
</p>

<p>
But we might as well have all been silent, so far as
any effect on Harold was concerned.  He had
promised and he was going&mdash;and that was the end of it.
So the outcome of the whole matter was a kind of
tacit agreement, before we parted for the night, that
Harold was to have his way.
</p>

<p>
When Gordon and I were in our own room, the
door tightly shut, I pleaded with him to accept a plan
that my poor bewildered mind had conjured up.
"Let me write to uncle," was the burden of my cry;
"if our boy is leaving us because we're not able to
support him, uncle could change all that; he could at
least undertake to complete his education&mdash;and I
know he will, I know he will."
</p>

<p>
But Gordon's face was like marble.  In the last
appeal a Scotchman is always Scotch&mdash;and I knew
Gordon was thinking of that last night when he had been
all but turned from uncle's door.  "Not while we
have a crust to eat or a hand to toil," he said, in a
tone so low and resolute that I actually feared to
press my argument with another word; "no child
of mine shall be dependent on his father's enemy;"
which language smote me to the heart&mdash;nor do I
think Gordon would have uttered it in a calmer
mood.
</p>

<p>
Before we put out the light, his face still white and
drawn, he took me by the hand and led me towards
the bed.  We knelt and prayed together&mdash;but my
heart was bleeding.  And anyhow&mdash;it is hard to write
it down&mdash;Gordon and I didn't seem so close together
now, when we prayed, as we once had been.  I had
the phantom feeling that we prayed apart.  He had
beckoned me, years before, in to faith's Holy Place
where the Divine Saviour waited for us both; I had
faltered in, groping for the way, bringing a broken
and contrite heart&mdash;and I had found my husband
gone.
</p>

<p>
It was the deep dark before the dawn when I slipped
noiselessly into Harold's room&mdash;and I prayed
beside his bed.  I loved to hear him breathing; and I
wondered if God could hear <i>me</i>&mdash;my soul, I mean,
half panting in its loneliness.

<i>"THE VOICE OF RACHEL"</i>
</h3>

<p>
When I began this chapter it was with the
purpose of telling about grandfather's
home-going.  But not to his beloved
Scotland, of whose heathery hills he seemed to think
more fondly and speak more longingly as the years
went by.  It never lost its charm for us, this loving
talk of the old Scotch shepherd about the far-off hills
and valleys of his native land; even I, who had never
been near them at all, came to be quite familiar with
those sunlit slopes, their glistening heather, their
babbling springs, their bleating flocks that roamed
from base to brow.  No, not to Bonnie Scotland&mdash;as
he fondly called it&mdash;but to a fairer clime, did the
weary shepherd turn his face at last.
</p>

<p>
But before I come to this I must tell of something
else; something I would to God might be left
unrecorded, for my pen is aching while I write.  But this
other&mdash;what I am about to tell&mdash;had its own part, I
think, in starting dear old grandfather on the long
journey from which he will return no more.  For it
is about Harold, who was grandfather's idol, as I have
already said.
</p>

<p>
Our son had gone away, grief and hope mingling
with the last farewell.  That memory is with me yet.
Indeed, I never rise early now, around five or six,
without the feeling that some one dear to me is
going far away.  I remember the sweet calm of the
early dawn, the first glad notes of the singing birds,
careless of human tears, the sparkle of the dew upon
the little lilac bush before the door, as we went past
it with Harold's trunk.  What a hard time I had to
press into Harold's hand the poor little dollar I had
saved from our scanty means as my own special gift&mdash;how
pathetic it was to see the care with which he
tucked it away in a painfully capacious pocketbook
that grandfather had given him; how lonely it looked
in the infinite space around it!  And I remember
how poor old grandfather noticed it, and how he
bewailed himself that he had not kept till then the
hundred pounds he had brought with him from Scotland.
But this, his only wealth, had been "invested," as he
had told us over and over again for months after the
investment had been made.  Poor grandfather! we
had heard nothing for long of the speculation that
had looked so rosy to him then.
</p>

<p>
And I remember, most vividly of all, what a time
I had trying to comfort Gordon when he came back
from the station.  After all, perhaps I must admit
that a father loves his son quite as much as his
first-born girl.  And it seemed strange that I had to be
the strong one, but so it was.  When evening came,
and we had family prayers, Gordon's pleading didn't
comfort me at all.  But I had learned long before this
that the new view of prayer refuses to concede that
anything can change "the course of nature"&mdash;I hate
that phrase&mdash;and teaches that it is only communion,
pious meditation, and not supposed to be used for
asking for what you want.  So Gordon had gradually
given up asking for particular things, though heaven
knows there was enough to ask.  Higher critics are
the highway robbers of the soul.
</p>

<p>
Well, everything went along smoothly enough for
nearly a year.  Harold wrote twice a week, and
seemed delighted with his work.  He expected soon
to be promoted, one of his last letters said; and
Gordon told me that a general manager gets twenty
thousand a year&mdash;that is, after he gets the position,
of course.  I used to think Harold was having a
pretty lively time&mdash;socially, I mean&mdash;and he seemed
to spend a good deal on clothes.  But he did copying,
and other things, out of hours, and made almost
enough to pay his way.  And we knew he was asked
out a great deal, as bank clerks always are&mdash;and that's
enough to turn any young fellow's head.  Society
seems to do its very best to ruin such youths as turn
their footsteps towards a bank; Gordon said himself
that most of these clerks do more credit to their
tailor than their schoolmaster.  As for me, if I
had fifty sons not one of them would ever go into
that profession with my consent&mdash;unless he began as
general manager, with twenty thousand a year.
</p>

<p>
By and by Harold began to get interested in
sports&mdash;mostly lacrosse, I think&mdash;and that was the portal
to our Gethsemane.  I shall not dwell upon the sad
and bitter story.  But one day a letter came from
Carletonville; the envelope bore the bank's name,
but the address was not in Harold's hand.
</p>

<p>
"It's about his promotion, Gordon," I said exultantly;
"it's about Harold&mdash;he's been raised at last.
You open it."
</p>

<p>
Gordon was radiant.  "No, Helen," he said
unselfishly; "he owes it more to you than me&mdash;open
it yourself.  He gets his financial ability from his
mother," and he leaned forward to hear me read the
news.
</p>

<p>
I opened it so carefully; for I meant to preserve it
always&mdash;till he was general manager, at least.  My
eye ran swiftly over the contents and I fell with a
loud outcry into Gordon's arms.
</p>

<p>
I scarcely need to tell the story further.  The
letter was not unkind&mdash;I remember remarking that, in
a numb, mechanical way, in the midst of all the agony.
There was even a little stern note of sympathy in it,
as the authorities outlined the piteous tragedy.  I
suppose they knew we had human hearts.  It was
the old story; debt, then betting, then petty
irregularities in the hope that the deficit would soon be
overtaken.  Then a little more; then a false
signature&mdash;I cannot write the other word; then
more&mdash;and the man who wrote us used the term
embezzlement.  That was when I fainted in Gordon's arms.
</p>

<p>
All that night I lay awake, alone.  Gordon had
left by the first train to go to Harold.  I pleaded
with him to bring our boy home with him.  And
I shall remember to all eternity how white his
lips were when he said he would&mdash;<i>if he could</i>.  I
knew what he meant; and I fell to trembling so that
I could hardly say good-bye.  Then I went to bed
and lay all night staring wildly into the dark.  And
that night, for the first time in all my married life, I
cursed poverty&mdash;out loud I cursed it with bitter
emphasis&mdash;the poverty that made us so helpless now.
For I fancied, poor thing, that all would be well if
the money could only be replaced.  I cared nothing
for the tokens of poverty that were all about me, the
poor and ill-furnished house, the scanty wardrobe,
the meagre larder&mdash;these were but trifles to me then.
But I thought bitterly of the people I knew in
Hertford who had plenty of money, once friends of ours,
but lost to us now; and I silently impeached the poor
people of our mission, as if they were somehow
responsible for it all.  I blamed Gordon, too&mdash;it was
all due to his wandering from the beaten path&mdash;and
I breathed out threatenings and slaughter against
every German theologian that ever lived.
</p>

<p>
It was a couple of hours before the dawn when
my heart suddenly fell to beating wildly&mdash;some one
was gently trying the front door, the knob slowly
moving back and forward.  I listened, trembling; a
moment later all was still.  Then I heard steps
moving round on the walk beneath my room; I rose
and crept to the open window, finally summoning
strength to call out a timid challenge.
</p>

<p>
"Mother, it's me&mdash;it's Harold, mother," came a
subdued voice from below.
</p>

<p>
I almost fainted for very joy.  I was never so
happy before in all my life; an intoxicating sense of
gladness, rioting like a flood, rushed over me as I
turned and flew down-stairs to the door.  A moment
later my arms were about my son as I led him,
sometimes laughing, sometimes crying, back to my room.
I remember how tight I closed the door behind us,
as if we were to be shut in together forevermore.
And then he crept into bed beside me, just as he had
done in the dear old days when he was a little
fellow; and I lay with my cheek close to his, my arms
about him, no word of reproach, even of enquiry
coming from my lips.  A strange unreasoning joy it
was that possessed me&mdash;I might have known it could
not last&mdash;and I called him by all the old tender
boyish names while my hands roamed among his hair,
sometimes descending to trace the features of his
face, just to make sure that he was there.  I
remember how, more than once, there flitted before me a
vision of the far-off days when he had lain a babe
beside me, nourished at my breast&mdash;at which I held
him closer than before, my bosom aching with its
load of love.
</p>

<p>
He told me all about it; about the tragedy; and
I listened like one dead.  I know now what they
feel who stand before the Great White Throne,
awaiting the word of destiny.  Harold's voice grew
lower as his speech went on, and as it grew nearer to
the dawn.  He seemed to fear the return of morning.
And slowly, with ghostly outline, it was made clear
to me that he could not linger&mdash;that he was not my
own at all.  They were likely in quest of him even
now, cruel men, scornful of a mother's love; perhaps
already hurrying towards his father's house.  My
arms were strong, I knew, infinitely strong&mdash;and
they closed about him again in a passion of
possession.  Yet I knew how weak and powerless they
would be if that other arm, the law's mighty arm,
should be outstretched upon him.
</p>

<p>
So I bade him go.  First with gentle entreaty,
then with insistent urgency, then with vehemence of
command, I thrust him from my crying heart.  I
arose, groping for some garments that might help
the disguise he would surely need&mdash;with feeble
cunning I refused to light a lamp&mdash;searching for this
and that to serve our piteous purpose.  With what
difficulty, I remember, did I find one of Gordon's old
hats, dusting it carefully, and changing its shape
from one form to another to make it look more
natural on Harold's head.
</p>

<p>
Soon we were at the door.  The dawn was glimmering.
"Go, my darling," I said hoarsely, "there
will be few about when you catch the morning train.
Come to me once again&mdash;put your arms around me,
tight&mdash;kiss me, my son."
</p>

<p>
But he did not move, looking down shame-facedly
at the ground.  Again I besought him to be
gone.
</p>

<p>
"How can I?" he said abruptly at last, the
words like to choke him; "I have no money,
mother."
</p>

<p>
This smote me like a blow.  But suddenly and
with a little cry of joy&mdash;such strange eddies are there
in the stream of sorrow&mdash;I remembered a few dollars
I had sorely saved for the purchase of the new gown
I needed so.  I sprang back into the house and
reappeared in a moment with the scanty savings&mdash;I
caught the rumble of distant wheels and knew the
world would be soon astir.  Harold's face fell as he
glanced at the money I thrust so triumphantly into
his hand; it was not enough&mdash;I might have known
it could not be enough.
</p>

<p>
We stood together, bowed with disappointment.
Suddenly the rumbling wheels came nearer, till, as
they hove in sight around a corner, I saw it was the
milkman's wagon.  A quick inspiration came to me
as I bade Harold slip back into the house.  The
milkman's ruddy face showed its surprise as his eyes
fell on me, for he was accustomed to leave his wares
at the back door and go upon his way.  I greeted
him as calmly as I could; and then, not without
shame, I boldly asked him if he could lend me a
little money.  "A friend of mine is going away," I
said, "on the morning train&mdash;and he doesn't happen
to have quite enough."
</p>

<p>
The honest swain, nothing doubting, fumbled in
his pockets, finally producing a good deal more than
my poor savings had amounted to.  I took the
money from him, my heart beating wildly at the
sudden deliverance.  Then I went in to Harold and put
it in his hand.  It hurt me, beyond words to tell, to
see the confusion and pain with which the poor lad
took the money, though it was from his mother.
Then his eyes suddenly filled with tears.  "Can't I
say good-bye to Dorothy?" he said brokenly; "I
want to say good-bye to Dorothy."
</p>

<p>
The tenderness of his tone almost overcame me.  I
put my arm about him and we went up-stairs together,
quickly, for the time was passing.  We could hear
grandfather's heavy breathing as we passed his door;
Harold looked in wistfully, but I shook my head.
Dorothy was sound asleep, her golden curls
dishevelled on the pillow, her lips slightly parted, a
much worn doll emerging from beneath one arm.
My eyes only glanced at her, then turned to Harold's
face, silently filling as I saw the evidences of his
grief.  He stood a moment above the bed, then
stooped and kissed the rosy face; she stirred, smiling
in her sleep, her hand unconsciously moving towards
her doll.  He kissed her again, unwisely&mdash;and the
blue eyes opened wide.
</p>

<p>
"Harold," she murmured sleepily, "dear Harold&mdash;I
knew you'd come home&mdash;I dreamed you were
never going away any more."
</p>

<p>
The boy's lips were quivering, and we turned
softly towards the door.  But Dorothy, still only half
awake, uttered a plaintive protest.  "Don't go away,
Harold," she mumbled, "get into your bed, Harold&mdash;your
own beds," one half-opened eye indicating an unused
couch beside her.  "Say your prayers and then
come&mdash;kneel down there, Harold," drawing the
battered doll away from the side of the bed.
</p>

<p>
He looked at me.  I motioned; and we knelt together,
Harold's hand close beside the vagrant curls.
His voice was faint and faltering:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Now I lay me down to sleep,<br />
  I pray the Lord my soul to keep;<br />
  If I should die before I wake<br />
  I pray the Lord my soul to take."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
He paused, preparing to arise.  "Say the rest,"
Dorothy murmured, "say it all, Harold."
</p>

<p>
Again he looked at me.  Then his face sank
between his hands and once more the broken voice
went on: "God bless father, and mother, and
Dorothy&mdash;and bless Harold and make him a good
boy, for Christ's sake.  Amen."
</p>

<p>
The little monitor seemed satisfied, slipping back
again into the stream of slumber.  Harold and I went
gently down the stairs.  I spoke no word but held
him to my bosom, aching still, with such a fierce
flame of longing as I had never known before.  I
opened the door; even then I paused to adjust the
hat, so large and serious looking, on his head.  He
passed out, his face averted, and started running on
his way&mdash;on, on, away from home, away from his
mother's empty arms.
</p>

<p>
I went back to the room where his sister lay.
Long I stood above the vacant bed, wondering bitterly
why I had not gloried more in those old golden
days when two dear tiny heads lay upon the pillows
there.  A few minutes after I heard the whistling of
a train; I sank beside the empty bed and tried to
pray&mdash;but my lips, I know not why, could frame no
words except the words of Harold's prayer.
</p>

<i>"COME, ETTRICK; YARROW, COME"</i>
</h3>

<p>
It was two long days before Gordon returned to
me.  He knew the worst, of course, but had
lingered at Carletonville in the hope that he
might get some trace of Harold.  A telegram to me,
and another from me to him, told enough to send him
home at once.  Poor Dorothy's eyes looked wonderingly
upon us as her father held me in his arms so
long and so silently after he came in the door.
Grandfather turned his troubled face away,
pretending to gaze out of the window.
</p>

<p>
"You look so old, Gordon," I said unguardedly, as
I drew back to look once more on the haggard face.
</p>

<p>
"I <i>am</i> old, my darling," was all his answer, as he
drew me to him again.
</p>

<p>
I forget what we talked about that evening&mdash;it was
a dreadsome hour.  And I actually feared for Gordon.
He seemed half crushed, and half defiant, sometimes
breaking out into a flood of grief, sometimes sitting
long in stony silence.  I felt guilty in the thought
that I was more composed than he; once or twice
I caught myself admitting that my faith was stronger
than his&mdash;but I dismissed the comparison as
pharisaical.  Yet that was my chief concern for my
husband&mdash;I feared for the influence this sorrow would
have on his secret life.  I knew then, oh! how well
I knew, that only one anchor could hold amid a
storm like this.  And the very ones who had taught
me this were God and Gordon.
</p>

<p>
The gloaming was just deepening into dark when
I came back to the study after telling Dorothy good-night;
grandfather's chair was close beside Gordon's,
the white head visible through the gloom.
</p>

<p>
"Noo's the time to use yir faith," the old man was
saying softly; "naebody needs a licht till the mirk
gathers roun' aboot them.  An' there's ae thing,
there's ae thing, my son, ye maun aye keep sayin' to
yirsel': the laddie's juist as dear to God as he is to
you an' Helen&mdash;if ye love him, it's because God loves
us a'," and the quivering voice fell on my harrowed
heart like music from some steeple far aloft.  "Aye,"
he went on as if to himself, "Harold canna' wanner
ayont the Faither's care&mdash;an' we can aye follow him
wi' prayer.
</p>

<p>
"Rax Gordon the Buik, lassie," he suddenly said,
after we had sat a while in silence.
</p>

<p>
I did as I was bidden and Gordon received it
without a word.  It seemed to me, though perhaps it
was only fancy, as he held it a moment, then opened
it slowly and began turning the pages over, that there
was a reverent eagerness about it such as had long
been wanting.  I wondered, fearfully, if this new
ministry were already working its blessed way.  And
he passed Hosea by, though he had been reading for
some time from that section of the Scriptures; he
had some books on those old writers that he was
delving into, and he always read at family worship
from the parts he was studying for himself&mdash;there
was so much of this that I had really grown weary
of the prophets, shameful though it may be to confess
it.  Gordon still turned the leaves, nor stopped
till he came to the fourteenth of St. John: "Let not
your heart be troubled," which he read with a
trembling voice that interpreted it beyond all the
power of German scholarship.  It was like a great
anthem to my soul that night, and I think I gloried
as much in Gordon's voice as in the wonderful
words.
</p>

<p>
When we knelt to pray I slipped over to Gordon's
chair, and we bowed together, his hand tight clasped
in mine.  I prayed for Gordon all the time we were
bended thus, my heart full of a kind of thankful joy
that mingled strangely with the passion of loss and
loneliness already there.  The prayer was beautiful;
and just before its close Gordon stopped, tried again,
then faltered out with a kind of sob:
</p>

<p>
"And, oh, God, give us back our son&mdash;bring him
back to us, oh, Father of us all."  My heart leaped
for joy, like one whose long night was almost past.
</p>

<p>
No word was spoken as grandfather and I slipped
out a few minutes later; I went with him to his
room, to see that everything was ready.  "The guid
Shepherd'll bring the wannerin' lamb hame yet," he
said as I turned to go, the strong features struggling
with emotion; "He'll bring them baith back&mdash;back
till Himsel'&mdash;did ye no' tak' notice o' Gordon's
prayer?  He's comin' hame, thank God, he's comin'
hame," and the old man's voice was touched with
heavenly hope.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The next morning, grandfather was astir with the
birds.  The day was bright; and the weather&mdash;so
long his daily care&mdash;was still a specialty of
grandfather's.  Indeed, he seemed to live more and more
in the past, the farther it receded.  For days he
would talk of little else but the far-off Scottish hills,
and the glint of the sun through the clouds upon the
heather, and the solemn responsibilities of the
lambing season, and the sagacity of his sheep-dogs, all of
whose names he remembered.  How often, especially,
would he tell us of "Ettrick" and "Yarrow," two of
his choicest collies, named for his native streams.
"This wad be a graun' day for the sheep," or "there'll
be mony a lammie i' the plaid-neuk the day," were
frequent opinions of his when sunshine or storm
provoked them.
</p>

<p>
Poor dear grandfather!  Far though he was from
his beloved Scotland, it was beautiful to see how
deep and tranquil was the happiness of his heart.
He knew, of course, how sore was our own poverty,
and I think it chafed him sorely that he could not
help.  When he first came out to the Western world,
and to his only child, I really believe he thought the
hundred pounds he brought with him would make
him well-to-do for life.  His idea was that all
investments, in this new land, break into golden harvest.
So he had duly invested his hundred pounds&mdash;some
eloquent agent had led him on&mdash;in some sort of
mining stocks.  Old-country people are so prone to
think that the earth, on this new continent, and the
waters under the earth, and the mountains on top of
it, all turn to gold if you touch them.  Well, he
invested his hundred sovereigns, and that was the end
of grandfather's financial career&mdash;but have I not told
all about this already?
</p>

<p>
Yet he was happy in his children&mdash;for so he regarded
us both&mdash;and in his children's children.  But
that morning, the morning after Gordon came home,
he seemed collapsed with sorrow.  Perhaps it was
the reaction&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but it was evident,
anyhow, with what absorbing love grandfather's heart
had gone out to the now departed Harold.  His face
was thin and worn, as if he had been ill; his voice
was husky and his step was slow.  All through
breakfast he never broke the silence except to speak
of Harold, and it was pathetic to hear the various
suggestions the loving heart conjured up as to the
best way to get him back.  He knew little about
law, dear grandfather, except the law of love.
Finally Gordon told him, perhaps too candidly, that
Harold was doubtless by this time from under his
country's flag, and that there was no absolution
unless the money were refunded&mdash;not even then, he
added, except by the grace of those whom he had
wronged.
</p>

<p>
"He'll write to us onyway, will he no'?" grandfather
asked plaintively at last.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," I said quite confidently; "oh, yes, he'll
write."
</p>

<p>
But Gordon seemed anxious to prepare me for
possible disappointment.  "He likely will, if he's
getting on well," he said slowly, fearfully; "if he
succeeds, wherever he is, I mean.  If he doesn't,
I'm&mdash;I'm afraid."
</p>

<p>
I dissented warmly from this.  Harold loved his
mother, I affirmed.  And then I remember how
Gordon said something about the change in a boy's
whole nature that an experience of this kind is liable
to bring about; a word or two about the moral
sensibilities being blunted, or something of that sort.
Whereat I flared up in warm remonstrance, breaking
into eulogy of my son.  It was not till afterwards that
I realized how all my thought of Harold, when he
came home that night, and when he went away, was
always of his misfortune and never of his sin&mdash;almost
as if he had been pitifully wronged.  But I suppose
that is the way of every woman's heart, and I cannot
but think it is partly God's way too.
</p>

<p>
Early in the forenoon grandfather disappeared,
sending word by a messenger that he had availed
himself of an opportunity to go into the country.  It
was evening when he returned, but I never saw a
man more changed.  His face was aglow with strange
enthusiasm and the signs of healing were upon him.
</p>

<p>
"I juist couldna' help it," he said apologetically as
he entered, his shepherd's crook in his hand.  "I
was fair longin' to see the sheep, an' the hills, yince
mair&mdash;my heart was sair for them.  An' I got a
chance wi' a mon that was gaein' oot&mdash;he was settin'
up some kind o' machinnery.  An' I had a graun'
day on the hills," he went on delightedly; "it was
fair graun'.  There was a laddie mindin' some sheep&mdash;he
was a fine laddie; he minded me o' Harold&mdash;and
I helpit him a' the day.  There wasna' ony heather,
nae doot&mdash;but the hills were bonnie&mdash;and the laddie
had a collie dog or twa that minded me o' hame.
An' I carried yin puir wee lammie in my arms&mdash;it
was ailin'&mdash;and I lilted the auld psalms yince mair
aneath God's blue sky; it was maist as guid as hame,"
and the aged voice was all aglow with gladness.
</p>

<p>
"You had a lovely day for it, grandfather," I said,
smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Aye," he answered, "it was a bonnie day&mdash;an'
aboot yin or twa o'clock there cam' a wee bit
rain&mdash;a Scotch mist, ye ken, and it minded me o'
hame&mdash;oh, it's been a graun' day the day.  But I canna'
think what it was gied me sic' a longin' for the hills&mdash;it
was fair fearsome&mdash;it's no' a'thegither canny, I'm
dootin'," and the old man shook his head in an eerie
kind of way, so characteristic of his race.  "I'm
gaein' to bed," he said, moving already towards the
stair; "I'm fair din oot.
</p>

<p>
"What's yon black thing hangin' there?" he suddenly
demanded, the keen eyes resting on the door
at the back of the hall.
</p>

<p>
I paid little or no attention to the question,
deeming it unimportant; we went on talking for a few
minutes.
</p>

<p>
"Lassie," he suddenly broke out again, "run,
lassie, an' see what's yon black thing hangin' on the
door."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy went as directed.  "It's mamma's rain
coat," she said a moment later, returning with it in
her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Aye," said the old man, apparently relieved,
"aye, it's naethin' but a cloak&mdash;but it fashed me to
look at it; I thocht it lookit like&mdash;like yin o' thae
crape things," he added with an embarrassed little
laugh.  This gave me a queer creepy feeling at the
time, but I thought little more about it then; it came
back to us later on, however.
</p>

<p>
Grandfather went to bed immediately, and Gordon
and I were not long behind him.  It was about one
o'clock, I think, or perhaps a little later, when I was
wakened from my sleep by a strange sound, half
groan, half cry.  I went out at once into the hall
and soon traced the sign of distress to grandfather's
room.  The old man was raised up in the bed, partly
sitting; and the light I quickly kindled told the story
in a flash as I glanced at the ashen face.
</p>

<p>
"It's my heart," he said huskily; "it's yin o' thae
spells like I had lang syne.  It winna' be lang, I'm
dootin'."
</p>

<p>
I was terrified, for I thought I could descry the
stamp of death already.  There was a majestic calm,
an unwonted stillness, upon the old man's face.  I
called Gordon at once; he evidently shared my fear,
for he rushed away for a doctor.  It was but a few
minutes before he returned with the physician.  The
latter was not long in telling us the truth.
</p>

<p>
"It's simply a total collapse," he whispered to
Gordon and me as we followed him out into the hall.
"He can hardly live till the morning; yes, it's his
heart&mdash;a case of syncope.  Don't be alarmed if he
grows delirious, or semi-delirious&mdash;they often do,
just from sheer weakness.  That roaming about the
country, to-day, that you spoke of&mdash;and the excitement
of it&mdash;have probably been too much for him."
</p>

<p>
"Shall we tell him?" asked Gordon, pale and
trembling.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it would be just as well.  Has he everything
in order?&mdash;his will, I mean, and everything
like that, you know?"
</p>

<p>
"That isn't important," said Gordon; "father had
little to will&mdash;yet I think he ought to be told.  But I
cannot&mdash;I couldn't do it.  Will you?"
</p>

<p>
The doctor nodded and turned slowly towards the
room.  We did not hear what he said, but a moment
later grandfather faintly called for Gordon.  We both
went into the chamber of death.
</p>

<p>
"Rax me my wallet&mdash;you'll find it in the kist,"
said the old man, pointing towards a trunk in the
corner of the room.
</p>

<p>
Gordon handed him a large leather case which a
brief search revealed.  The shaking hand fumbled a
moment or two before it withdrew a somewhat bulky
document.  "This is what they gi'ed me for my
hunnerd pounds," he said, a half-shamed smile
coming over the strong features.  "They ca'ed them
stocks," he added, "stocks in a mine, ye ken.  I got
the shares for saxpence each&mdash;an' they said they was
awfu' valuable&mdash;and I tuk a' they'd gie me for a
hunnerd pounds."  Then he named a certain mine in
Northern Ontario, and I thought I saw the faintest
smile on Gordon's face.  He took the paper from
his father's hand and laid it on the table.
</p>

<p>
"I made the shares ower to Helen, lang syne,"
the old man said humbly; "gin they turn oot to be
worth onythin', they're for her.  I didna' ken when
I micht be ta'en awa'&mdash;an' it's aye weel to be ready."
</p>

<p>
I faltered some poor words of thanks which the
sinking man did not seem to hear.  A new, strange
light came into his eyes as we waited beside his bed.
The doctor had withdrawn now, powerless to do more.
</p>

<p>
"Gang an' fetch the plaidie," he suddenly directed,
"the yin I used to wear at hame; an' pit it aboot
my shoulders&mdash;the nicht's growin' cauld.  An' I
canna' find the sheep," he suddenly cried, half
starting in his bed; "I hear them bleatin' on the
hills&mdash;but I canna' find them a'."
</p>

<p>
Then his eyes, large and luminous with the light
of the unseen, revolved slowly till they fixed
themselves on Gordon.  "Kneel doon, laddie," he said
gently, yet with the majesty of a prophet, "kneel
doon beside me."
</p>

<p>
Gordon knelt low by the bed; one trembling hand,
outstretched, was laid upon his head.  The dying
eyes looked far beyond into the Unknown.  "Gordon,"
he said, almost in a whisper, "I see yir mither&mdash;she's
wi' us noo."  I actually started and looked
up, following the lifted gaze.  "An' she's lookin'
doon at ye, my son&mdash;an' the love is fair shinin' frae
her een.  It was her that made ye a minister, my
laddie.  When ye was a wee bit bairn, me and her
gi'ed ye up to God; an' mony a night, when ye
didna' ken, she bendit by yir bed an' pleaded wi' God
to mak' ye a minister&mdash;a minister, my laddie, o' the
Everlastin' Gospel.  Div ye hear me, Gordon?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, father, yes," and Gordon was sobbing now;
"yes, I hear, father."
</p>

<p>
"An' she wants ye to keep the troth, my son.
I'm gaein' to her noo&mdash;an' I'll tell her ye'll be a guid
minister, Gordon, a guid minister o' the New Testament,
leadin' puir sinners to the Cross.  Wull ye no'
bid me tell her that, my laddie?" and the dying lips
paused for answer.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," faltered the broken man beside the bed,
"yes, father, tell mother that."
</p>

<p>
The light of peace stole across the aged face.
"I'm ready to gang noo," the gentle voice went on,
"an' yir mither's beckonin'.  I'm comin', mither;
I'll be wi' ye soon.  An' Gordon's comin' tae&mdash;an'
Helen&mdash;an' they'll bring baith the bairns wi'
them."  Then his eyes turned slowly upon Gordon.  "I'm
ready to gang noo in peace," he said faintly&mdash;"but
there's yin puir lammie," a troubled expression
looking out from the dying eyes, "there's yin puir lammie
that I canna' find.  Oh, my son," the voice rising
again and the prophet-like eyes fastened upon
Gordon, "tak' guid care o' the sheep&mdash;it's an awesome
thing to be an unfaithfu' shepherd; tak' care o' the
sheep, my laddie&mdash;an' where's Harold?  Is the bairn
no' hame the nicht?"
</p>

<p>
Then swift delirium seemed to seize him, and he
rose violently where he lay, the last eddy of life
swirling in the sullen stream of death.  "I canna'
find the lamb that's wannered," he cried, in a voice
that startled us; "I canna' find it, an' the mirk is
fallin'.  Ettrick, come!&mdash;ho!  Yarrow.  Where are
ye, Yarrow?  Find it, my bonnie&mdash;find it and bring
it hame."  Then suddenly the dying lips pressed
themselves together and a faint whistle floated out on
the midnight air.
</p>

<p>
I seized Gordon by the shoulder.  "Hush," said
my husband, his face like death itself; "hush&mdash;he's
calling his dogs."
</p>

<p>
"They're breakin'," he cried despairingly; "the
sheep's scatterin'&mdash;they're gaein' to wanner&mdash;where's
my crook?  Gordon, bide ye here, my laddie, till yir
faither turns them back.  Come, Ettrick&mdash;Yarrow,
come!" and again the dread whistle floated from his
lips.
</p>

<p>
We tried to compose him, speaking tender words.
Slowly the look of peace stole back upon the old
man's face.  He lay with eyes almost closed.
"They're a' hame noo," he murmured gently; "aye,
they're a' safe in the fold, my laddie, an' they'll gang
oot nae mair till the mirk is by&mdash;we can rest noo
till the mornin'," as he lay back in calm content.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the dying eyes were lifted to his son.
"Lilt me a psalm," he murmured; "we'll sing afore
we gang to sleep; but dinna' wake yir mither&mdash;yir
mither's restin'."
</p>

<p>
"What shall I sing, father?" Gordon asked in an
awesome voice.
</p>

<p>
"A psalm, my&mdash;laddie," the words coming faint
and slow; "ye ken the yin I'm needin'&mdash;there's only
yin psalm for a shepherd."
</p>

<p>
Gordon looked at me.  One hand was in his father's;
the other was outstretched to me, and I knelt beside
him.  Then with trembling voice, my clearer note
mingling with Gordon's quivering bass, we sang together:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want&mdash;<br />
  He makes me down to lie,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and just as we were midway in the majestic strain
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Yea though I walk through death's dark vale<br />
  Yet will I fear none ill"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
the old shepherd passed through the valley with his
Lord.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>

<br />
<i>A SELECT CONGREGATION</i>
</h3>

<p>
Grandfather was right.  The Good
Shepherd had brought Gordon back.  I am
quite at a loss to tell just how the change
came about, or what its actual evidences were&mdash;but
the great ministry in accomplishing it was the ministry
of sorrow.  Sorrow and love&mdash;that ever undivided
pair&mdash;seemed to have conspired for their perfect work.
It began, I think, with the crushing weight that fell
upon our hearts in the loss of Harold and in all the
shame and anguish connected with it.  That was
God's way, I have always thought, of teaching
Gordon how much a father's heart can suffer&mdash;and the
inevitable outcome of that is the Cross itself if God
our Father be.  How could His love escape love's
inevitable pain, any more than ours?  Then, besides,
grandfather's home-going had been a second ordination
for Gordon, and the ministry that followed was
new and beautiful.  So was mine, if I may designate
my poor service by such a lofty word; for now I
knew beyond a peradventure that God hears and
answers prayer.  I verily believe grandfather and I
prayed him back between us.
</p>

<p>
The very day after Gordon's father entered into rest
I was sitting in the gloaming, thinking of the life that
had gone from us; one never knows how dear is an
aged life, till the silver-haired presence is withdrawn.
And I heard something that started my heart singing
heavenward with gratitude.
</p>

<p>
Gordon and Dorothy were at the piano, on which
our daughter now loved to show her new-found skill.
And softly on the evening air there floated out to me
the strains of the hymn he had asked her to play.
Surely there is no music, this side of heaven, so sweet
as that which a man's strong voice and a girl's
fluttering note combine to make.
</p>

<p>
"We'll sing it again," I heard Gordon saying;
"every word is golden, Dorothy.  Come now:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Jesus loves me, He who died<br />
  Heaven's gate to open wide;<br />
  He will wash away my sin<br />
  Let His little child come in'"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and then followed some words of Gordon's which
I could hardly catch.  But I heard enough to
know that he was teaching our little girl the great
and blessed doctrine which he himself had learned
by his mother's knee.  How I gloried in this new
theology, asserting once again its holy spell upon my
husband's heart, no human tongue can tell.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The months went by.  And if ever a man was
happy in his work, that man was Gordon Laird.  In
his work, I say&mdash;for our home lay still under the
shadow of its great and bitter sorrow.  After one or
two unsatisfactory letters, followed by a final one of
despairing note, no word had come from Harold.
This was what Gordon had feared.  Those months
stand out before me now, each one almost separate in
its pain, like sombre mountain peaks robed in cloud.
I know all about the anguish of those who roam some
desert waste searching for a spring, or with parched
lips upturned to the unsoftening skies.  The slowly
dying hope, the burning fever whenever I heard the
postman's knock, the sickening disappointment, all
surge again like a turgid flood about me when I
allow my mind to dwell on those days of silence.
</p>

<p>
Yet if I suffered I believe Gordon, in a deep, silent
way, suffered even more.  My heart ached more for
him than for myself.  I almost came to change my
mind as to which of the children had first place in
Gordon's heart&mdash;it seemed to cry out now for Harold
as for nothing else on earth.  Although, and I write
it gladly for the comfort of some like stricken soul,
all this worked its gracious ministry upon his troubled
life.  Embattled long as his spirit had been with
inward misgiving and silent doubt, this last dark mystery
would have wrought sore havoc, I cannot but believe,
had it not been so terrible.  Its very fierceness of
attack drove him in upon the Lord whom he had found
afresh; and his soul found its comfort in simplicity of
faith and childlike urgency of prayer.  The songs we
shall sing in the Yonderland shall give their chiefest
praise for the burdens that were too heavy to be
borne alone.
</p>

<p>
I have spoken of Gordon's urgency of prayer.  It
was he, not I, who suggested that we should have a
set time, every morning, when we should pray for
nothing else but this&mdash;that Harold might be brought
back to us.  And it was Gordon, not I, who led
Dorothy to include in her evening prayer the plea
that God would bring her brother home.
</p>

<p>
Yes, I think sometimes that the great Father led
my husband into the wilderness for this very purpose,
to make him a minister after His own heart.  I said
to him once, just about the time we first began to
realize we weren't going to hear from Harold:
</p>

<p>
"All this won't affect your life-work, will it,
Gordon&mdash;your preaching, I mean?" for it was only
natural, after all that had transpired, that I should
have some secret misgivings.
</p>

<p>
His answer lingers with me like a chime of bells,
though it came in tones subdued and low: "No,"
he said; "no&mdash;I'm going to preach now to broken
hearts."
</p>

<p>
"Then you'll never lack a congregation, my darling,"
was the response I made; and I have always
thought it was given me in that hour what to speak.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap26"></a></p>

<h3>
XXVI
<br /><br />
<i>THE NEWS A BROKER BROUGHT</i>
</h3>

<p>
Nor did the congregation fail to come.
Gordon had wonderful powers, as
everybody must know by this time&mdash;he had
always had them&mdash;and now he had a wonderful
message.  His heart, and not his brain, was now the
source of his splendid sermons; a wounded heart at
that&mdash;and it is from the crushed and broken flower
that the sweetest perfume breathes.  So it was no
wonder that his humble pulpit became like a golden
fount to parched and thirsty souls; and the pathway
trodden by the throng that pressed about it became
ever more deep and wide.
</p>

<p>
People came to Gordon's little church from every
part of Hertford.  I did not wonder at this, for rich
and poor alike will crowd about a spring; but little
by little it became evident that not a few of our
worshippers were from Gordon's old congregation in
St. Andrew's.  It's wonderful how everybody loves a
hero&mdash;especially if the hero doesn't know he's one.
I was the first to notice this; or, at least, the first to
say anything about it.  Gordon gave no sign of
exultation, but I knew it filled his heart to overflowing.
Strangely enough, one of those who by and by
were most regular in attendance was Mr. Ashton
himself, his first appearance almost striking Gordon
dumb.  But I always thought he really began to
esteem my husband that night Gordon dealt so faithfully
with him.  Besides, he had lost his own son&mdash;by
the more kindly way of death&mdash;and I attributed
it partly, too, to that.  It matters not.
</p>

<p>
This feature of our congregation&mdash;the attendance
of St. Andrew's folk, I mean&mdash;became so pronounced
at last that it began to be rumoured about
the city that many of them would like to call their
old minister back again, if he would return to their
denomination.  I spoke of it once to Gordon&mdash;my
heart could not conceal its eagerness&mdash;but he received
it after such a fashion that I mentioned it no more.
Not then, at least.  But I'm afraid I hoped and
longed; for I was born a woman, and pride died hard
within me.
</p>

<p>
Our means were still as meagre, our struggle as
sore as ever.  Besides&mdash;and how pitiful was the
effort&mdash;we were trying in a poor helpless way to save
a little for the payment of Harold's debt; we tried to
set aside just so much as his schooling would have
cost, if he had never left us.  Every penny thus laid
away had our hearts' blood upon it; and was, I doubt
not, precious in His sight who gave those two mites
their fame.
</p>

<p>
Things were at their very darkest along this line
about four or five months after Harold went away.
And it was just then something happened that
showed conclusively which way the ruling passion
of Gordon's heart was turned.
</p>

<p>
I was almost weeping over my accounts that night.
These I kept in a ridiculously large scribbling book,
marking down the smallest item of expenditure; for
Gordon entrusted our finances to my hands, if so
elaborate a term may be devoted to so scanty an
exchequer.  Generally I brought the account out
pretty even at the close of every week&mdash;"sundries"
were a great help towards this happy end.  But this
particular night everything seemed all "through
other," to quote a favourite phrase of grandfather's.
Nothing was clear except that there was a deficit&mdash;and
that was dreadfully evident; but even the all-adjusting
sundries could not show just how or whence
it came.
</p>

<p>
So there we sat, I with the big scribbling book
before me, a freshly sharpened pencil in my hand, a
cloud of perplexity on my brow, gazing, a little
moistly I'm afraid, at the plaintive statement of
receipts and expenditure.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, Helen," Gordon said, "you've done
the best you can&mdash;and I know you've made every
dollar go as far as any woman in the world could do.
Don't bother any more about it&mdash;charge that deficit
up to profit and loss and call it square."
</p>

<p>
"But it's nothing to laugh about," I answered
gloomily; "we're going behind, Gordon&mdash;just as sure
as anything, we're going behind."
</p>

<p>
"Only financially," he said lightly; "we're going
ahead other ways, my dear."
</p>

<p>
"But that's a lot," I protested.
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't seem much to me," Gordon replied,
the lightness all vanished now.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" I said, looking up a little
testily, I fear.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, only this; when anybody has a sorrow so
much greater&mdash;like ours&mdash;financial troubles don't
amount to much.  I want Harold&mdash;oh, Helen, I
want our boy back again," with which he broke out,
strong man though he was, into such a storm of crying
as would have done credit to the tearfullest of
women.
</p>

<p>
This puzzled, almost alarmed, me.  Indeed, I was
beginning to fear, and not without more reasons
than one, that the long tension of grief and
disappointment were proving too much for Gordon's
intense and sensitive nature.  I looked at him a
moment as he sat before me with his head bowed in his
hands; then I did what I believe was the very wisest
thing&mdash;I comforted him for a little as best I could in
my woman's way, though my heart was just as heavy
as his own; then I said we really must go on with our
accounts.  And in a minute or two we were both
bended once again above the big scribbling book,
going into every item as carefully as though we were
auditing the books of the Bank of England.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, just as I was declaring that the butcher
must have sent that same bill twice, a ring came to
the door.  I was glad.  Gordon answered the summons,
as he always did at night.  And, to my amazement,
our visitor turned out to be a Mr. Bradwin, one
of the well-known brokers of Hertford, and a
prominent member of our old congregation in St. Andrew's.
</p>

<p>
"Excuse my calling at this time of night, Dr. Laird,"
he apologized, after he was seated and a few
words of greeting had passed between us; "but the
fact is I've just received some news that I think you'll
find decidedly interesting"&mdash;I cannot be positive,
but I really think he glanced about the shabbily
furnished room as he spoke&mdash;"and I couldn't wait
till to-morrow to tell you."
</p>

<p>
"I hope it's good news, Mr. Bradwin," said
Gordon, a very faint smile playing on his face.
</p>

<p>
My impulsive nature got the better of my
judgment.  "Is it about St. Andrew's, Mr. Bradwin?" I
asked in an eager voice, my eyes leaping from his
face to Gordon's.
</p>

<p>
"No, it isn't," replied our caller, and my eyes fell.
"But it's good news for all that&mdash;decidedly good
news, I should say.  It's about something a little
more important&mdash;to you, at least; something that has
more to do with your happiness, I fancy."
</p>

<p>
Gordon sprang to his feet and his voice rang out
like a pistol-shot: "It's about Harold, sir&mdash;it's about
our boy!"  He was standing in front of Mr. Bradwin
now, his cheeks like snow, his eyes like fire.  It
was almost awful to see him.  "Thank God," he
cried, his voice half a laugh and half a cry; "you've
heard where he is, haven't you?&mdash;and you've come
to tell us.  Why didn't we think of it before,
Helen?&mdash;we might have known that was the news that
couldn't wait.  Tell me, sir&mdash;tell us both," and in his
eagerness he bent over and took the astonished man
by the shoulders.
</p>

<p>
A moment later his withdrawn hands were clasped
upon his eyes with a gesture of inexpressible grief
and he was groping his way to a chair.  No word
had been uttered; but the denial spoke from
Mr. Bradwin's face, or else he shook his head in
disavowal&mdash;I could not see, but I knew that the
hope glowing a moment since in Gordon's heart
was in ashes now.  Our visitor's news was not of
Harold.
</p>

<p>
"I'm so sorry," Mr. Bradwin began confusedly;
"I forgot all about that&mdash;about your son; and I
really almost hate now to tell you what I was so
anxious to tell a little while ago.  But it's good news,
at any rate&mdash;even if it's not the best."  Having said
this he paused, looking from one to the other of his
auditors.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Mr. Bradwin?" I asked, not a little
curious.
</p>

<p>
"It's about some stocks&mdash;some shares," replied the
broker, feeling a little more at ease with the familiar
words; "such assets&mdash;stocks, I mean, especially
mining stocks&mdash;are always springing little surprises on
the people that hold them.  Both ways, Mrs. Laird,
you know&mdash;both good and bad," as he smiled, a little
artificially I thought, at me.  "But in this case I'm
glad to be able to say the surprise is a pleasant
one&mdash;a decidedly pleasant one, Mrs. Laird; indeed,
uncommonly so, I should say.  Quite beyond the
ordinary, as I think you'll agree."
</p>

<p>
I stammered out something about my ignorance of
all such matters.  Gordon said nothing, for interest
was now dead within him.
</p>

<p>
"You are aware, of course," Mr. Bradwin resumed,
"you're aware, Mrs. Laird, that the shares
are in your name?&mdash;they were transferred to you
by Mr. Laird, your husband's father, before his
death."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," I exclaimed, beginning to remember; "you
mean those papers grandfather gave us?"
</p>

<p>
"Precisely, madam&mdash;at least, I presume we're
thinking of the same thing.  Your father-in-law
invested five hundred dollars, a hundred pounds rather,
in the mine&mdash;and they've just struck a fine vein of
silver&mdash;the richest yet discovered in New Ontario,
there's no doubt of that.  The old gentleman got his
shares for a song&mdash;about ten cents each, I believe&mdash;and
now they've jumped to an almost fabulous price.
So the profit is tremendous," as Mr. Bradwin drew
his chair close up to mine, all embarrassment
vanished now.
</p>

<p>
"How much are they worth?" I asked with feminine
precipitancy.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bradwin drew a pencil from his pocket and
reached over to the table for a piece of paper.  It
did seem funny that the scrap he picked up and began
to cover with figures was that wretched butcher's
bill that had been giving Gordon and me so much
trouble a few minutes before.
</p>

<p>
"Surely I've made a mistake," he said after a little
silence; "it seems an incredibly large amount.  No,
that must be it," drawing in his breath in an
awe-stricken kind of way after he had revised his reckoning
at least three times; "yes, your shares are worth
that, at the very lowest computation," and he handed
the greasy butcher's bill, transfigured and glorified
now, over to my shaking hand.  "I'm commissioned
to offer you that much, madam, for every share you
hold."
</p>

<p>
I don't think I heard him.  My first move was to
Gordon's desk in the corner, a great womanlike fear
seizing me lest the precious papers had been lost, or
that they might reveal something to disturb this fairy
dream.  I fumbled in one of the drawers; they were
there; I drew them forth.  Yes, it was just as the
broker had assured me.  The number of shares was
so plain that he who ran might read.
</p>

<p>
"Hold on to those certificates, Mrs. Laird," I think
I heard Mr. Bradwin say; "there's a heap of happiness
in them."  But I paid no attention to his words
as I moved over, my eyes so cloudy I could hardly
see, to where my husband still sat in silence.  I cared
nothing that a stranger was looking on, thought of
nothing, remembered nothing but the long years of
bitter poverty and secret struggle through which
poor Gordon had carried on his work so bravely.  I
threw myself into his arms, my whole frame shaken
with the emotion that would not be repressed; I
clasped him about the neck, the precious documents
crushed in my fevered grasp as I drew the yielding
head gently down upon my bosom, faltering out as
best I could the tidings that our poverty was ended
and our days of darkness past and gone.  And I told
him how I loved him for all the splendid courage and
silent self-denial that he would never need to practice
more.
</p>

<p>
"I'd advise you not to sell outright, madam&mdash;that's
my advice to you as a friend," the broker's voice
announced in a monotone.  I looked up a moment&mdash;the
man's back was turned; (wherefore I have thought
more kindly of brokers ever since).  "Your best way
will be to sell a certain amount&mdash;and retain an
interest; an interest, Mrs. Laird.  They're going ahead
to develop the mine&mdash;and then you're sure of both,
Mrs. Laird.  And I&mdash;I congratulate you, madam."
</p>

<p>
I fear my response was very scant, if indeed any
came at all.  At any rate, Mr. Bradwin withdrew a
minute or two later, announcing his purpose to
return the following day.
</p>

<p>
But it could not have been more than a minute or
two after his departure when we heard the footfall of
some one ascending the steps to the door.  "He
must be coming back," I said; "I suppose he's
forgotten something."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think it's a man's step," said Gordon;
"it's a boy, if I'm not mistaken."
</p>

<p>
His surmise was correct.  A boy it was, and a very
agitated and urgent boy at that.  He was ragged too.
</p>

<p>
"I want you to come with me," the lad broke out
as soon as he was admitted, fixing his earnest gaze
on Gordon.  "I was at Bethany Sunday-school last
Sunday&mdash;and I know you&mdash;and I want you to come
home with me quick," twirling his battered hat in his
hand as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"What's your name, my boy?" asked Gordon,
moving over to him.
</p>

<p>
"It's Tim&mdash;Tim Rayfield&mdash;an' we live on Finner's
Flats," naming the most notorious section of the city,
part of it bordering on Gordon's parish.
</p>

<p>
"Do you always attend Bethany, Tim?" asked
Gordon, smiling down at the desperately earnest face.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, wasn't there only once," answered the
boy; "but I learned a lot&mdash;an' won't you come, sir?
There ain't no time to lose.  My father's dyin',
sir&mdash;an' I want you to get him in."
</p>

<p>
"What?" and Gordon's face was full of amazement;
"in where?&mdash;where do you want me to get
your father in?&mdash;you mean the hospital, do you, my
boy?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir&mdash;into heaven.  That's what the teacher
said about it last Sunday&mdash;about when folks was
dyin'&mdash;an' how they get 'em in.  An' dad, he's
dyin'&mdash;an' I want you to get him in."
</p>

<p>
The face of the poor ignorant child was aglow with
its eagerness of hope and fear.  The signs of poverty
and neglect were everywhere about him, and the
ill-nourished frame told how severe had life's struggle
been to him.  But the glint of the Eternal was on
the grimy face, upturned to Gordon in wistful
entreaty.  His plea was the plea of love, his prayer the
prayer of faith; and the scene could not have been
more holy if some white-robed priest had been
interceding before the Throne.
</p>

<p>
Gordon's arms went out impulsively towards the
lad; I believe he put them a moment about his neck.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my boy," he said in an unsteady voice;
"yes, I'll go.  And we'll get your father in&mdash;yes,
please God, we'll get him in."
</p>

<p>
They went out together into the darkness, the boy
leading the way with such haste as stirs the feet of
those who race with death.  And I was left alone,
the little table still littered with the relics of our
financial conference.  The stainful butcher's bill lay
on top of all&mdash;and the magic document, with its
story of our shares, was still held tightly in my
hand.
</p>

<p>
I did not open it again; but I sat long looking at
it&mdash;and it struck me even then how helpless it was to
aid in the real tragedies of life.

<br /><br />
<i>WHERE GUS CAST ANCHOR</i>
</h3>

<p>
I have asked Gordon to write down for me his
experiences of that night.  Two considerations
led me to this course: first, because the incident
had so much to do with his own soul's life, his
faith, his future ministry; second, because Gordon
was so much more able than I, when one of life's
great events was concerned, to tell it as it should be
told.
</p>

<p>
When I asked him to undertake this duty&mdash;to
write out the story of that midnight errand&mdash;I
practically had to tell him I was putting our life
experience, or a large portion of it, down in black and
white.  But I don't think Gordon ever suspected it
was meant for other eyes than those of our own
immediate dear ones&mdash;and one of the great moments of
my life will be when my husband sees this book, if,
indeed, it shall ever deserve a name so great.
</p>

<p>
Here is Gordon's story of that night, just as he
wrote it out himself&mdash;I told him my story began with
a foreword, so he said he'd have one too.
</p>

<p>
<i>Foreword:</i>
</p>

<p>
I am writing this, so personal though it seem,
because Helen wants it.  If it hadn't been for the
children's mother, their father never could have told
what he is now about to write.  Some time, perhaps
long after my poor day's work is done, they may
read this page from the volume of their father's life.
May the same grace enrich, the same truth ennoble
their youthful lives: "The angel that redeemed me
from all evil bless" them both, as a father's lips
prayed long ago.
</p>

<p class="thought">
******
<br />
</p>

<p>
When little Tim Rayfield told me he wanted me
to "get his father in," I knew one of the crucial
moments of my life had come.  Indeed, I felt the hour
was almost as critical for me as for Tim's dying
father.  Why, I need not state at length.  But
perhaps I ought to say this much, that I felt a new sense
of power as I pressed on through the night with
Tim's grimy hand in mine.  I use the word "new"
advisedly&mdash;for I must tell, no matter whose eye may
yet read the confession, that, for some years before, I
had shrunk from such scenes as these in helplessness
and despair; I had lost the joy of the miraculous in
my ministry; I can honestly say that I always tried
to be faithful to every duty, but little by little the
glory and the power of a Supernatural Gospel had
slipped away from me.
</p>

<p>
I have seen people smile when I use the word
"supernatural" as the only fitting term to characterize
a gospel.  But such as smile have very smiling
lives.  The word&mdash;and all that is behind the word&mdash;has
a very different meaning when laughter is banished
from the lips, when the voice of joy is hushed,
when some fateful sorrow falls and we can only
stumble on through the encircling gloom.  Such an
hour came to me, filled with a bitterness worse than
death; it was then I found my Lord anew.  When
the billows overswept and whelmed me I learned to
pray; when the shadows closed in about me I
descried the Divine Friend among them; when I lost
my boy, and my father-heart was broken, I learned
of One who gave His own Son, His well-beloved
Son.
</p>

<p>
Let me revise my words.  It was not I who
"found my Lord"; but He found me&mdash;He and
Helen&mdash;and they sought me hand in hand.
</p>

<p>
"That's the room," said Tim, panting from his
haste, for the little fellow had led me at great speed;
"there, d'ye see that light in the window&mdash;that
upstairs window?"
</p>

<p>
I saw, and in a moment we were climbing a decrepit
stair.  Groping our way along an unlighted
passage, my guide, still clinging to my hand, turned
sharply into the squalid home.  It consisted
evidently of two rooms, the inner of which contained
the couch whereon lay Tim's sinking father.
</p>

<p>
The boy never stopped till he had led me to the
very edge of the bed.  A few tattered covers
wrapped the form of the dying man.  His face,
already conforming to the stamp of death, told the
story of a lifetime's sin.  Nobody could look upon
it without reading there the tokens of a life of
passion and excess.  The heavy eyes looked up sullenly
into my face as I stood above him.
</p>

<p>
"It's the preacher, Gus&mdash;don't," pleaded a woman
who bent above him; for his lips were framing some
word she evidently feared my ears would catch.
"Don't, Gus&mdash;he's goin' to help you if he can; Tim
fetched him&mdash;he's the preacher from the Hollow, an'
Tim seen him last Sunday."
</p>

<p>
The man's set features seemed to relax a little as I
took his hand.  I hesitated as to how I should best
begin&mdash;but he opened the way himself.
</p>

<p>
"I'm all ready for sea, boss," he broke out with a
gasping laugh; "last voyage, looks like&mdash;an' nobody
don't know the port.  But I've got my papers,
Cap'n&mdash;I've got my papers, an' I'll have to sail."
</p>

<p>
"Don't mind him, sir," his wife said in a hushed
voice; "he's an old sailor, you see&mdash;only two years
since he quit the sea and come here to live.  He got
his left foot hurt&mdash;an' that's what's killin' him
now&mdash;he's got gangarene, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Goin' to be a dirty night, boss, by the looks o'
things," the dying tar broke in with pitiful bravado;
"the wind's risin', ain't it&mdash;better shorten sail, eh?"
</p>

<p>
I put my face close to his.  "Do you want a
pilot, my friend?" I asked him low.
</p>

<p>
"Don't call me that," he retorted gruffly; "call
me mate&mdash;I was mate on the <i>Dolphin</i> when that
dam crowbar fell on my foot."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you want a pilot, mate?" I asked again.
</p>

<p>
"Where to take me?" looking far through the
window into the dark.
</p>

<p>
"To the harbour," I answered softly.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know where it is."
</p>

<p>
"He knows."
</p>

<p>
"Say," and the eyes were now fixed very intently
on me; "I'm goin' to ask ye a question.  An' I
want an answer straight&mdash;no tackin' or manoeuvrin'&mdash;d'ye
think I'm dyin', Cap'n?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I answered; "yes, you're dying, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Then get him in," broke out poor Tim with a
piteous wail as he presented himself in front of me
and looked up into my face; "please get him in
quick, afore he dies&mdash;that's what I fetched you for,
sir&mdash;oh, please get him in."
</p>

<p>
I had seen the day when I almost feared to be
alone with a dying man.  What I had to say, in
those days, could be as well said to others as to him.
But now, as Tim besought me, and as his father
looked up with eyes in which a yearning hope
was already to be seen, I felt that no others must
be near while I sought to help his soul.  So I
asked Tim and his mother if they would withdraw to
the adjoining room&mdash;they should be called, I said, if
the summons came apace.
</p>

<p>
Then I closed the door&mdash;for this hour had more
than bridal holiness&mdash;and I gave myself in love to the
dying soul.  The mock heroism, the banter, fell off
from him like a garment, for I think he saw I believed
in God.  I need not tell, must not reveal, all he
disclosed to me from the dark storehouse of a wasted
past.  But I met him, and his crimson sins, and his
accusing conscience&mdash;I met them all, and at every
turn, with the Cross of the Lord Jesus and with the
all-atoning grace of God.  How I gloried in that hour
in the great evangel!  And how there rolled about
me, with tides ample like the ocean's, the thought
of the magnitude and infinitude of the love of Christ!
And how&mdash;oh, blessed memory to my long beleaguered
soul&mdash;I witnessed the ancient miracle with joy,
marvelling anew at the greatness and glory of the
Gospel, scorning with high contempt all that would raise
its feeble hand against such power as may be seen
wherever a sinful soul meets with the pardoning
Lord!
</p>

<p>
Over and over again I read to him from the third
of John: "God so loved the world that He gave His
only begotten son," its richness growing on my own
soul as well as his.
</p>

<p>
"Let me see that," said the dying mate; "I want
to look at it&mdash;every cap'n reads the log himself."
</p>

<p>
I gave him the book and held the lamp above him.
</p>

<p>
"Ye haven't got another of them, have ye, sir?" he
asked wistfully.
</p>

<p>
"Of what?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Of this here book&mdash;I want to read it when you're
gone; or Tim&mdash;Tim could read it to me."
</p>

<p>
I told him, of course, that I would leave the book.
</p>

<p>
"Turn down the page&mdash;mark the place," he said,
handing me the volume.  "I'm afeared I'd soon be
driftin' again if we lost it."
</p>

<p>
"I'll mark some other passages too," I suggested,
"some almost equally beautiful."
</p>

<p>
"That there one's enough," he said, sinking back
faintly on his pillow.
</p>

<p>
I sang him a hymn, the one that dying men should
always hear; and then I had a little prayer with him.
His hands were folded and his eyes were closed.
When I rose from my knees he whispered something
that I shall treasure while memory lasts.  But it
needed only a glance to see that the end was near.
I opened the door to call his wife and child back to
him.
</p>

<p>
"Did you get him in, sir&mdash;did you get my father
in?" were the first words that greeted me as little
Tim's eyes leaped to mine.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my boy&mdash;yes, please God, your father will
get in," though I could hardly speak for the tears
that choked me, so full of elemental power was the
pleading of the child.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Nancy," and the old tar's voice was very
tender; "come close up beside me.  My foot ain't
hurtin', Nancy&mdash;an' my heart ain't hurtin'&mdash;nothin's
hurtin' any more.  I've cast anchor."
</p>

<p>
"What d'ye say, Gus?" his wife asked in a
wondering voice.
</p>

<p>
"I've cast anchor&mdash;where the preacher read.
You'll leave the book, sir?" his voice swelling for a
moment&mdash;"an' you're sure ye marked the place?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said, "I'll leave it&mdash;and it's marked."
</p>

<p>
"Call me mate," the strange impulse prompting
him again.
</p>

<p>
"I marked it, mate&mdash;and I turned down the page."
</p>

<p>
"Then sing me that again&mdash;that bit about the gale."
</p>

<p>
"What gale, mate?"
</p>

<p>
"That gale&mdash;the gale of life&mdash;that's how it went
before."
</p>

<p>
I knew now what he meant.  Nancy's face was in
her hands and little Tim's eyes were fixed lovingly on
me as I began.  When I came to the lines:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Hide me, oh my Saviour hide<br />
  Till the storm of life is past"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
the dying man suddenly interrupted: "That'll do,"
he said, his voice barely audible, "that's the
bit&mdash;that's enough&mdash;that, an' the place ye marked."
</p>

<p>
We were soon all standing by his bed.  The struggle
was quickly over.  Suddenly his face assumed an
expression of peace so deep that I thought the
harbour had been really won.  But his eyes opened
wide and both hands went feebly out; Nancy took
one in hers, the other clasped by little Tim.
</p>

<p>
"The anchor holds," he murmured; "Nancy, the
anchor holds."
</p>

<p>
A moment later his wife turned from the bed, her
apron to her face, groping her way with bitter
outcry towards the adjoining room.  Tim followed; and
through the open door I could hear the boy's shaking
voice:
</p>

<p>
"Don't cry, mammy; oh, mammy, don't cry so
hard.  Dad got in, mother&mdash;the preacher got him in."
</p>

<p class="thought">
******
<br />
</p>

<p>
I sat up till Gordon got home that night, for I had
much to discuss with him.  The precious document,
with its wizard tidings of mining shares, was still
before me as he entered; and I broke out with some
word about what Mr. Bradwin had said.  But when
I looked up and saw the far-off look of peace on
Gordon's face, I knew it was sprung from some other
source than this.
</p>

<p>
"You seem so happy, Gordon," I said; "what
makes it?"
</p>

<p>
He told me; but when he spoke about that last scene&mdash;he
has called it the anchor scene ever since&mdash;his
voice faltered so he could hardly go on.
</p>

<p>
"We'll put these away to-night," I said, picking
up the papers.  "But what do you intend to do
with&mdash;with the money, Gordon?"
</p>

<p>
"I hadn't thought of it," he answered calmly.
Then, after a pause; "but I think we'll enlarge the
chapel.  It needs it, you know&mdash;and this seems like
a glorious chance to do it."
</p>

<p>
I wonder if my face showed my dissent.  At any
rate, I took the mighty charter and restored it to the
desk.  "There's one thing we'll do first, Gordon," I
said in a voice that implied finality, "and you won't
dispute it, either."
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Helen?" his words full of wonder.
</p>

<p>
"We'll pay that&mdash;that debt of Harold's," I said,
my face averted as I leaned over the desk.
</p>

<p>
He was silent for long.  "Yes, Helen," he answered
quietly at length; "yes, we'll do that first&mdash;that's
as holy as the other.  Oh, Harold, my son, my
son&mdash;I wonder where Harold is to-night," the words
ringing with a nameless pain.

<h3>
XXVIII
<br /><br />
<i>"TO OLD POINT COMFORT, DEAR"</i>
</h3>

<p>
I shall begin this chapter, perhaps the closing
chapter of my artless story, with the simple
statement that we were back again in St. Andrew's
Church.  This restoration was effected
about seven months after the incident with which the
last chapter had its close.  How it came about, or
why, I shall not pause to tell.  But there was a
vacancy there&mdash;in St. Andrew's, that is&mdash;and the
thought of nearly the whole congregation had
gradually turned towards Gordon.  He had proved
his worth, had fought a fight so stern and long, and
had come out of it with a faith so clear and a power
so manifest, that it was only natural they should covet
his ministry again.
</p>

<p>
He returned gladly enough, pride and gratitude
mingling in his heart; and the Presbytery seemed
rejoiced to welcome him within their fold again.  He
still retained Swan Hollow&mdash;this he insisted upon&mdash;as
a kind of associate charge.  They gave him an
assistant, and Gordon selected a young minister fresh
from Edinboro', for Scotchmen are the most clannish
of all living things&mdash;and they worked the two places
together, taking the morning and evening services
alternately.
</p>

<p>
Going back to the church was gladsome enough
to me.  But it was the veriest trifle compared with
our return to the dear old manse, where our children
had been born.  What memories thronged about us
when the nightfall found us once again beneath the
roof of St. Andrew's Manse!  A few were there to
welcome us; we tried to make merry with them&mdash;but
my heart ached till they should be gone.  And
then, hand in hand as in other days, Gordon and I
went up-stairs to the little room where our treasures
used to lie.  Only one was there that night, our lovely
Dorothy, and she lay in slumbering beauty where she
used to sleep before.  The other bed was beside hers
as in the days of yore&mdash;I had directed that it should
be so&mdash;but it was empty.
</p>

<p>
Poor Gordon!  All the joy, the triumph even, of
his return to the scene of our former life was lost in
sorrow because that bed was empty.
</p>

<p>
"I'd sooner be in the poorest hovel, Helen," he
said as he stood beside the unused couch, "if Harold
were only back&mdash;Harold and Dorothy.  Our cup of
happiness would be full, wouldn't it, dear, if both
were only here?"
</p>

<p>
"But he'll come back some day," I tried to assure
him; "that's why I have his bed all
ready&mdash;everything has always come right, Gordon, even if it did
come late."
</p>

<p>
"If we only knew where he is," Gordon went on,
not seeming to hear; "but it looks as if we'd never
learn.  Do you know," and the strong voice was
choked with tears again, "do you know, Helen, what
I wonder every night before I go to sleep?"
</p>

<p>
"No, what is it, Gordon?"
</p>

<p>
"I always wonder if he's cold&mdash;or hungry.  But
especially if he's cold.  Oh, surely there's nothing so
sweet to a father as tucking his children up at
night&mdash;so they won't be cold.  After we left here, the
home we went to was so little, and so hard to
heat&mdash;but don't you remember how we used to go in and
tuck them up, so warm and cozy?"
</p>

<p>
I tried my best to comfort him, though my heart
had its own load to carry.  For the dark mystery still
hung about us; we had heard never a word from
Harold.  His debt was paid&mdash;as has been told, or
implied, already&mdash;and nothing really stood in the way of
his coming back except that we did not know where
to find him.  And every effort to discern his whereabouts
had ended in utter failure.  But we still kept
the little tryst, still kept praying on, still hoping and
trusting that the Great Father would staunch the
wound which no human hand could heal.
</p>

<p>
The summer passed and still no tidings came.
</p>

<p>
Then I began to fear seriously for Gordon.  The
very splendour of his make-up was his peril; it is
ever so with natures such as his.  And his sorrow
seemed to find expression in an ever more passionate
devotion to his work, a devotion that was making
him the idol of his people, even if it brought him
daily nearer to collapse.
</p>

<p>
Which came at last.  It was one Sabbath in early
November, and Gordon had preached that morning
from the text, "I will arise and go unto my
father."  I suppose it was the tragedy whose home was his
own broken heart that inspired him; in any case, he
poured his soul out that day with a passion and
pathos such as none could have imagined who did
not feel the torrent of his power.  He seemed to
interpret the very heart of a lonely and imploring God.
</p>

<p>
But what the effort took out of him nobody saw
but me.  That he was utterly exhausted was evident
as he walked home after church, but I thought little
of it; yet, even then, I noticed a strange incoherency
in his speech, and a tremulousness about his voice,
that boded ill.  The collapse came during the
afternoon; by eventide he was not my Gordon any more,
his mind wandering far, voicing itself in strange
plaint and heart-breaking appeal, the name of his
absent Harold sounding through it all in pitiful refrain.
</p>

<p>
I don't think the physician I called in haste that
day knew anything about the skeleton closet in our
home&mdash;it is wonderful how soon people forget, even
those who know you best&mdash;but he located the hidden
wound with wonderful acuteness.  "It's an utter
collapse," he said; "what might be called a severe form
of nervous breakdown&mdash;it generally occurs with
people of strong emotional temperament.  Has your
husband had any great shock?&mdash;or has he been
carrying any specially heavy burden, probably for
months?"
</p>

<p>
I told him as much as I thought was necessary.
</p>

<p>
"Just what I surmised," he said; "he's suffering
from what the German physicians call 'the sad heart'&mdash;and
all this derangement is due to the sympathy
between the brain and the nerves.  Highly-strung
organism, you see&mdash;intense emotional nature, that's
evident; all this disturbance is a result of tension&mdash;the
strain was simply too much for him.  But he'll
recover all right&mdash;only it will take time, time and
rest."
</p>

<p>
A consultation followed soon; and the result of it
all was that Gordon was to be removed to other
scenes just as early as he would be able to travel.  I
watched by him night and day, and soon the first
storm of emotion was succeeded by a deep and silent
calm that I found almost harder to be borne than the
other.  He would sit by the hour poring over
Harold's old school books, or gazing at some boyish
photographs of the wanderer, or holding his cricket bat
or butterfly net lovingly in his hands.  Sometimes
he spoke of him, but not often.  When I told him
we were going away for a little holiday he consented
readily enough.
</p>

<p>
"Where shall we go, Gordon?" I asked him, with
but little hope that he would choose.
</p>

<p>
"We'll go to Old Point Comfort," he answered
unhesitatingly; "that's where we went before."
</p>

<p>
I had to turn away.  For there came before me,
with a flash of memory, the days to which I knew
my husband's words referred.  Old Point Comfort,
of dear and blessed memory!&mdash;thither had we turned
our steps the night of our wedding day, going forth
by the moonlit bay on our love-bright journey, the
future years, with all the thorny paths that awaited
us, veiled in the mist of happiness that arose from
our singing hearts.  Ah me!  I could see again
the unseamed face, the hair untouched by time, the
swimming eyes of love, when my lover was still young
and joyous, unworn with toil and care.
</p>

<p>
"That's where we'll go," I answered; "we'll go to
Old Point, Gordon."
</p>

<p>
The arrangements for our journey were soon complete.
I do not think, even were it possible, that I
would willingly forego all the discipline&mdash;and the
blessing&mdash;that our years of poverty had brought me;
but now I blessed the providence that had made it
possible for me to take Gordon away like this.  Money
was not lacking now&mdash;thanks to grandfather and that
blessed mine&mdash;and I joyed over it as men rejoice in
harvest or as robbers that divide the spoil.
</p>

<p>
The evening before the very day we were to start,
something occurred which wrung my heart as nothing,
not even the loss of Harold, had ever done before.
I had been compelled to leave Gordon for a little
while, some detail of preparation demanding my
attention.  Returning to the study, our usual resort, I
found it empty; and my heart chilled with fear.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Helen," I suddenly heard Gordon's voice
crying from without; "oh, Helen, come, come
quick."  There was a strange note of excitement, even of
rapture, in the voice that called me.
</p>

<p>
Hatless, coatless, I rushed out into the frosty night.
And just across the way, in a large adjoining yard, I
could see Gordon hurrying fast toward a little pond
in the distance.  Sometimes he looked back and
called me, then hurried on again, the strange
exultation still sounding in his voice.  When I overtook
him, he was clasping in his arms a wondering boy, a
solitary skater on the frozen pond.
</p>

<p>
"It's our boy, mother&mdash;oh, Helen, he's come at
last.  It's Harold, mother"&mdash;and I noticed in the
failing light that the lad was actually about Harold's size
and form.  "I knew you'd come back, Harold," he
cried as he held the youth to his bosom; "oh, my
son, I knew you'd come&mdash;but what made you stay
away so long?  And are you cold, Harold?&mdash;I've
been so afraid you might be cold."  Then he held the
startled boy out before him, his eyes lingering with
pitiful intentness on the face he held upturned to his
own.  "You've grown some," he said fondly, "but
you're my own Harold yet&mdash;come, come on home
now with me and mother.  Your bed's all ready for
you, Harold; and Dorothy will be so glad&mdash;she's
lonely, she's lonely for you, Harold."
</p>

<p>
I stood transfixed and mute with grief.  Then the
lad made some reply, I know not what.  But he
broke the awful silence with a word&mdash;and Gordon's
hands fell to his side like lead.  He stood a moment
under the trembling stars, then stooped and gazed
long into the face that had filled his soul with
fleeting rapture.  Slowly he turned, looked a moment
upward at the wintry sky, then silently moved
towards me.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't Harold," he said after a long pause, his
eyes searching my face with unutterable yearning;
"it's somebody else's boy&mdash;let us go home again,"
as we started back hand in hand.  The clock in an
adjoining steeple struck the hour as we went our
way; and its knell is with me yet.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The next day saw us off upon our southward
journey, Dorothy and Gordon and I.  The doctor
had filled me with high hope; the change of air, and
especially of scene, he said, were almost sure to do
great things for my dear one.  And the very features
that alarmed me most were those by which he seemed
to be reassured.  The very acuteness of the malady,
he said, was its most hopeful sign.  I have often
thought of this since and applied it to many things
other than bodily infirmities; the acute is the transient,
let all sufferers bear in mind, and all who think
life's battle hard.
</p>

<p>
We arrived at Old Point in the morning, and the
balmy air and genial skies seemed to help Gordon
from the first.  Oh, sweet Southern air and sweeter
Southern skies! how unspeakably dear to me I knew
not till I thus returned after all the maze of years.
It was so delicious to hear again the soft Southern
accent, to catch the liquid voices of the negroes, to
breathe in the fragrance of the flowers that bloom in
our dear Southland even in November.
</p>

<p>
I remembered&mdash;what woman would forget?&mdash;the
very room that had been ours when we were there in
that same hotel on our bridal tour so long ago, the
dearest little room, with a tiny balcony that looked
out upon the ocean.  And I arranged that we should
have it now&mdash;I would take no other.  Not a word
did I say to Gordon.  But the first night we were
there, after Dorothy had been safely stored away, I
was sitting beside him, looking out over the moonlit
harbour.  The night was hushed, the ocean calm;
voices of darkey stevedores floated softly up to us as
they moved hither and thither with their creaking
wheelbarrows on the wharf.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Gordon turned his face full on mine in
the moonlight.  "Helen," he began huskily, "do you
know what room this is, Helen?"
</p>

<p>
I yielded to his arms as he slowly drew me within
their shelter; "it's where we were before&mdash;when you
were my bride, my lovely, lovely bride," he said
softly; "did you know it, Helen?"
</p>

<p>
I nodded, smiling up to his bending face.  "Yes,
I knew it, darling," I said; "that's why I chose it,
Gordon."
</p>

<p>
I know not why it was&mdash;I suppose no one could
explain it&mdash;but the dawn came to us, and the darkness
rolled away, in that blessed hour.  Tears came
at last to Gordon; slowly at first; then in copious
flow; then in a gush of feeling that wrung his whole
form till it shook and sobbed like the frame of a little
child.  Passionately he held me, his kisses falling on
my lips while he murmured such words of love as
the days of courtship had never heard.
</p>

<p>
"It was like this before," he cried, pointing to the
radiant sea; "the moon shone on it, just like this.
And we were so happy then, darling&mdash;we didn't
know of the long years, with their care and sorrow,
that stretched before us.  And you've been so good,
Helen, so true and faithful&mdash;and so brave; whatever
I've done, or been, I owe to you, my darling," and
through all the gust of passion his voice had a
naturalness, his eye a new-found calm, that told
me the long dark night was past.
</p>

<p>
"We were so happy then, weren't we, dear?" he
said again after a little stillness.
</p>

<p>
"I'm happier now," I answered, nestling in.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" he exclaimed.  Then, suddenly discerning:
"I know why&mdash;it's because we have the
children now.  Isn't that why, Helen&mdash;isn't it
Dorothy and Harold?"
</p>

<p>
I told him Yes; and the fancy, if it can so be called,
seemed to help and comfort him.  "Yes," he said
musingly, "it's wonderful, isn't it, how we could
have been happy then at all&mdash;when we didn't have
them.  But God gave them to us, didn't He, Helen?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I murmured, my face hidden; "yes, God
gave them."
</p>

<p>
"And they're still His to give," he went on, a great
peace in his voice such as it thrilled my soul to feel;
"they're still His to give.  And I know&mdash;I'm almost
sure&mdash;that He'll give us Harold back again.  Something
tells me that it's coming near; I knew it when
I looked out on the water&mdash;when the dark fled before
the light that flooded it.  Don't you think so, my
darling?"
</p>

<p>
I forget just what my answer was; but we sat long,
soothing and comforting each other, drinking deep
from Memory's spring.  By and by Gordon fell
asleep with his head resting on my arm, the moonlight
still playing on the pure and lovely features as
we sat by the open window.  I brooded above him,
thanking God for the change I could see upon the
care-worn face.  The tide had turned, the reaction
had come at last, the strife of battle seemed spent
and gone.  All night long he slept the sleep of a little
child; the morning found him bright and tranquil, and
his first waking word was to say that he was well.
</p>

<p>
For a couple of weeks, or perhaps a little longer
we lingered on in our quiet retreat, every hour
blissful with its evidence of returning strength.  Gordon
spoke often of Harold, but always now with a sweet
trustfulness that was beautiful to see; I really believe
God made him well by touching his spirit with the
calm of a childlike faith.  It was a miracle, I have
never ceased to think, let the critics say what they
will.  And as his strength came back his heart began
to turn wistfully towards his work; I really don't
believe any one ever knew how much he loved
St. Andrew's, and had loved it all through the years.
</p>

<p>
I protested against his returning, but in vain.  So
it was all arranged that we were to start home on the
following Monday.  The evening before, Gordon
preached for a clergyman whose acquaintance he had
formed, the minister of a little Methodist church not
far away.  I was there, of course; and the sermon
was one of the noblest I ever heard Gordon give.  It
was from the words: "Casting all your care upon
Him," and I know every listener felt that the
message was heaven-born.
</p>

<p>
After the service was finished I was going down
the aisle alone, when suddenly I heard some one
pronounce my name.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Helen!" said the voice, and bygone years
rolled back upon me at the tone.
</p>

<p>
I swung around, wildly excited.  It was a voice
from home.  "Mr. Slocum!" I cried, so loud that
everybody stood still and looked at me; "Frank
Slocum!&mdash;Oh, Frank!" and I stood gasping in the
aisle.  It was one of the friends of my early
girlhood&mdash;the same who had been my escort to the ball
that far departed night when we had first discussed
the Presbytery, and the attic guest it was to bring us.
</p>

<p>
"I wa'n't right sure," he began, rosy as the dawn;
"but some one told me the preacher was Mr. Laird&mdash;then
I knew you were Mrs. Laird."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Frank!" I cried, "please call me Helen," for
the music of it was refreshing; "come away&mdash;come,
and go home with me and Gordon."
</p>

<p>
I believe Gordon enjoyed that evening with Frank
quite as much as I, which is saying a good deal.
He said afterwards that I reminded him of a child
running hither and thither through a flower-strewn
glade, plucking whatever her hands could reach.
Thus did I gather news from Frank.  My questions
rained in on him from every point of the compass,
leaping from one subject to another like a peewee on
the shore.  (That's a kind of witches' dance in
metaphors, I know, but they all mean the same thing
anyhow.)  I cross-questioned Frank about everything
and everybody, while Gordon sat listening with an
amused expression on his face.  Particularly did I
put him through his facings about my old schoolgirl
friends.  The first question, without exception,
was as to how many children they had&mdash;till this
became so chronic that Frank would begin with this
himself, not waiting to be asked.  It saddened me
some to learn that several of them had twice as
many as I.  One old friend, Sadie Henderson, had
exactly three times as many&mdash;but two of them came
at once, so that they didn't really count.  Others,
moreover, had none at all, which brought Gordon
and me pretty well up on the average.
</p>

<p>
Frank had little to say about Uncle Henry and
Aunt Agnes except that they were getting older,
which I would have surmised myself.  Besides,
Frank had a sensitive nature; and I suppose he
remembered the stormy scene when Gordon left my
uncle's house.  I fancied, in a woman's instinctive
way, that there was something he wanted to say to
me alone.  And I was right enough.  For when I
walked with him as far as the hotel piazza, while we
were gazing out over the shimmering sea Frank
told me something that proved to be a word of
destiny.
</p>

<p>
"You all are going back by New York, you said?"
he began, looking up significantly.  The idiom
sounded sweet&mdash;<i>you all</i>&mdash;how long since I had heard
that brace of words before!
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I answered; "why?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll tell you something interesting; I didn't
care to say it before your husband, for fear it might
affect his plans&mdash;I know how matters stand between
him and your uncle, you know&mdash;but I think you
ought to be told.  Your uncle's in New York."
</p>

<p>
"What?" I gasped, and I felt the colour leave my
cheek; "uncle's what?&mdash;he's where?"
</p>

<p>
"He's in New York," Frank repeated calmly.
"I've just come from there&mdash;we were staying at the
same hotel."
</p>

<p>
"And Aunt Agnes?" I asked swiftly, my eyes
fixed on him in the gloom.
</p>

<p>
"No, Mrs. Lundy's at home&mdash;your uncle went up
on some business, I believe.  Mighty successful too,
as far as I could judge," Frank added.
</p>

<p>
I cared nothing for this.  "What hotel, Frank?"
I demanded eagerly; "tell me the hotel."
</p>

<p>
"The St. Denis&mdash;opposite Grace Church, you know."
</p>

<p>
Little more was said and I soon bade Frank farewell.
Then I walked slowly back to Gordon, trying
to compose myself, struggling to subject my impulse
to my judgment.  But it was of no use.  My heart
was the heart of childhood once again; all I knew
was this, that a few hours would bring us to New
York, that we had intended going there anyhow&mdash;and
that my uncle was within reach of one who had
never ceased to love him.
</p>

<p>
I paused a moment before I opened the door and
went in where Gordon was still sitting, gazing out on
the ever fascinating scene.
</p>

<p>
"Well, dear, did you pump him dry?" he asked
jauntily as I entered.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Gordon," and now I was on his knee
(woman's throne of power) with his face between my
hands; "oh, Gordon, don't say No.  Don't, Gordon&mdash;won't
you do this for me, this, that I'm going to
ask?"
</p>

<p>
Soon I had poured out the whole story to him.  I
noticed his brow darken a little at first, and the
quivering lip told how much I had asked of him.
</p>

<p>
But Gordon was all gold through and through; he
always was, my Gordon was, from that first hour
when my eyes fell upon his face till now; and the love
of this later day, although I suppose folks call us
old, exceeds that early ardour as the noontide mocks
the dawn.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my wife," he said, stroking my hair and
looking with almost pitying fondness on my face;
"yes, brave heart and true&mdash;you were his before you
were mine.  And we'll go, Helen&mdash;we'll both go."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

XXIX
<br /><br />
<i>THE HOUR OF HEALING</i>
</h3>

<p>
The mighty city seemed hushed as I made
my way along the corridor of the old hotel.
But I suppose the hush was from my heart.
</p>

<p>
"You'll wait here, will you, ma'am?" and the bellboy
opened the door of the retired little parlour as he
spoke.  "I'll bring Mr. Lundy in a minute.  Yes, I
think he's in, ma'am; his room's on this floor.  Don't
you want me to take him your card?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I answered; "just tell him a lady wants to
see him here&mdash;an old friend of his."
</p>

<p>
The boy disappeared along the shadowy hall.  I
had but a few minutes to wait.  "This here's the
door, sir," I heard the boy direct; and then I could
catch the shuffling step, not yet forgotten, as a tall
and bended form came slowly into the room.  Keen
and curious was the glance that came from the enquiring
eyes, swiftly searching amid the failing light.
</p>

<p>
I knew him.  Only a glance I had, but it was
enough to revive the memories of girlhood, to carry
me back over all the waste of years, to recall with
lightning speed the love and laughter of the days
that were no more.  My heart leaped within me as I
saw the change that time had made.  Uncle was an
old man now, and the years had bowed the erect and
stalwart frame; snowy white was the hair that had
been but streaked with gray when I saw it last; more
serious than of old, but flashing the same kindling
light, the same lofty pride, were the kindly eyes
whose glow no years could quench or dim.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, uncle!" I sobbed, the storm breaking as in
a moment; "oh, uncle!  Uncle dear, it's me&mdash;it's
your little girl&mdash;it's Helen."
</p>

<p>
He had started back as I moved towards him.
But my voice arrested him, that wondrous feature
that changes not with changing years.  A moment
he stood, as though he had heard the trump of doom
itself.  Then, like an aspen, from head to foot he
trembled&mdash;and the fear flashed through my mind that
I had acted with cruel haste.
</p>

<p>
But the great cry which broke from him&mdash;no
articulate word&mdash;rang with such fullness of joy and
strength as to dispel my every fear.  A moment later
I was in his arms.  He bore me to the window, those
arms as strong as in other days, smoothing back my
hair as he leaned over and peered into my face.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, God!" the words coming like a prayer; "it's
Helen&mdash;she's come back.  But it's been so long&mdash;and
your hair's getting gray, Helen&mdash;and you look older
than when you went away."
</p>

<p>
I smiled, gazing up at him in sweet content.
"Count the years, uncle."
</p>

<p>
"The years!" he broke out with the old fiery
intenseness; "count the years&mdash;haven't I counted
them?&mdash;and the days, and the hours&mdash;waiting,
always waiting.  Oh, Helen, it's been long&mdash;it's been
so long.  But what could I do?&mdash;what could any
gentleman have done, when I passed my word
that&mdash;&mdash;  If your husband&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I laid my finger on his lips; then leaned up and
kissed them.  And our speech flowed back, half of it
almost incoherent, into the sweeter channels that laved
the happy past in which we were both content to
dwell.  Much of it was of my mother, my sainted
mother, for whom life's conflict had so long been
over&mdash;and uncle's tears were mingled with my own.
</p>

<p>
"There's only one thing I reproach you for now,
Helen," the gentle voice began, when the dusk had
deepened into dark; "one thing you should have
done&mdash;and that would have made our happiness complete."
</p>

<p>
"What's that, uncle?" I asked, greatly wondering.
</p>

<p>
"You should have brought Gordon with you&mdash;the
only difference there was, was with him, you know.
Surely he doesn't think I'm one of those old vipers
that carries things till death?" his voice less steady
than before.
</p>

<p>
"He's here," I said softly; "he's down-stairs."
</p>

<p>
Uncle sprang to his feet as if the years had
withheld their enfeebling hand.  "Bring him up&mdash;send
for him at once," he ordered, as though commanding
a regiment of soldiers.  "Ring the bell&mdash;where's that
boy?&mdash;are the servants all asleep?  These rascally
dogs they've got in the North&mdash;I wouldn't give Moses
or any good nigger for a bushel of them.  And are
your children&mdash;is the little girl with him now?"
</p>

<p>
His question cut me like a knife.  For I had kept
back part of our life's story, the bitter part, when uncle
had enquired about our children.  We only brought
one of them, I had said&mdash;but hoped he might see
Harold later on.  Which was true enough, so true, alas!
</p>

<p>
"I don't need you," uncle said abruptly as a servant's
head appeared at the door.  "I'll go to him,"
he announced to me&mdash;"I'll go to Gordon.  I hope I
don't forget what's becoming in a Southern
gentleman&mdash;besides, he's come far enough.  You wait
here&mdash;I'd know him in a thousand, unless he's enough
sight plainer than he used to be.  Always did have
a hankerin' for him, I believe, like a nigger for a
watermelon.  You wait here, Helen," and he made
his way, straightening himself with all the old-time
dignity, upon his courtly errand.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was the following evening, the evening of a day
that had been filled with unmixed gladness to me
and Gordon.  If it had not been for that one
skeleton closet&mdash;which I need not name&mdash;the whole
house of life would have been one big banqueting
hall to his heart and mine.  More than once, through
that happy day, I noticed Gordon's laughter die away
in silence and the brightness leave his eye as there
evidently floated before him the vision of the one
absent face.  Indeed, he said as much to me, that
all the gladness only threw into darker contrast the
abiding cloud that was always in our sky.
</p>

<p>
But uncle had been so lovely to us both this day;
and we had just finished dinner at some resort he
had discovered where Southern dishes, new and old,
were to be had in all their glory.  We were all
seated now in uncle's room; and the dear old man
was directing all his powers of persuasion upon my
husband.
</p>

<p>
"It's the purest play I ever saw in my life," he
urged, one hand holding Gordon by the knee; "it's
as good as a sermon.  I've heard heaps o' sermons
that didn't do me as much good as 'The Old
Homestead,' I tell you."
</p>

<p>
"I was never at the theatre in my life," my
husband made reply, "except twice I went to see
Irving&mdash;and I don't altogether believe in it."
</p>

<p>
"This is far better'n Irving," uncle urged; "and
you'll preach better after it."
</p>

<p>
"I don't feel much in the mood for theatres,"
Gordon responded; "my days for merriment are
past, I fear," which came with a smile that showed
he didn't quite believe it.
</p>

<p>
"That's the very time to go," insisted uncle;
"that's when you want to get the cobwebs blown
out of you&mdash;and this'll do it all right."
</p>

<p>
"I'll leave it to Helen," Gordon suddenly
exclaimed; "if she wants to go, I'll give in."
</p>

<p>
Five minutes before, I can frankly say, I had
hoped Gordon would carry his point.  The theatre,
that particular night, had no charm for me.  Yet
now that Gordon had left the matter in my hands,
some mysterious impulse settled my resolve at once.
Nobody need tell me that women, true women, live
far from the unseen.  For my resolve was taken on
the instant, so suddenly and confidently that it
amazed myself.
</p>

<p>
"We'll go," I said quietly.  "The play sounds
good; I'm sure I've heard of it before&mdash;and I want
to see it, Gordon."
</p>

<p>
Three-quarters of an hour later we were seated
five or six rows from the footlights, watching the
haymakers gathered about the moss-grown bucket
that gives its charm to the opening scene of "The Old
Homestead."  But the play had not proceeded far
before I began to regret bitterly that we had not
stayed away.  When it dawned on me that the plot
centred about an absent boy, a son for whom a father
sought in vain, I knew that Gordon's Gethsemane
was deepened by every word and act.  This
particular kind of anguish was realistic enough to us
both, without any representation so vivid.  Yet we
had to sit there, uncle alternately laughing and
weeping at our side, and witness the rehearsal of all
we knew so well.  I was sitting beside Gordon; and
I covertly got a hold of his hand, pressing it silently
to let him know my heart was aching too.  I found
myself, almost before I knew it, leaning forward in
an agony of interest and suspense as the great
emotions of a parent's love and loneliness were set forth
in terrible reality.  It was as if Gordon's heart and
mine were both laid bare that night; and I found
myself wondering if all this meant to any others in
that crowded throng what it meant to us.
</p>

<p>
Uncle was enraptured at our fixity; he knew not
the source of our deadly interest.  "Didn't I tell
you?" he whispered to Gordon as the tension came
near its height; "ever see anything like that before?
Isn't that true to life, eh?"
</p>

<p>
Gordon never spoke, his eyes looking far beyond,
as fixed as though set on death itself.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't that true to life?" uncle repeated,
accustomed to being answered.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, oh, God, yes&mdash;yes, it's true," I heard poor
Gordon falter as he bowed forward and covered his
face with his hands.  Uncle, dumb with wonder now,
uttered never a word.  I prayed for strength.
</p>

<p>
The tide ebbed and flowed, as is the way in plays,
laughter and tears following each other in quick
succession.  A wave of mirth&mdash;about the pillar box
incident, I think, when the old man imagines the
collector is robbing the mails&mdash;had just overswept
the audience when Gordon whispered to me that he
could stand it no longer.
</p>

<p>
"Don't go yet, Gordon," I whispered; "I think
he's going to find him," and I saw his face white
with the pallor of the dead.
</p>

<p>
He made no reply; but, clutching his hat, he rose
to go, swaying unsteadily where he stood.
</p>

<p>
I began reaching for my wraps and was just rising
to follow.  He paused to wait for me, holding out
his hand, I think&mdash;of this I am not sure.  But just
before we turned to go, my eyes were cast in one
farewell glance upon the stage.  My head reeled;
my heart stood still; my lips clave together, parched
and dry.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Gordon," I cried, bleating, "look, Gordon,
look," swimming towards him even as I pointed at
the stage.
</p>

<p>
His towering figure turned where he stood; and
his burning eyes, aglow with the passion that was
rending him, leaped to where I still pointed with
outstretched hand.  Then I straightened myself too, as
one might gather his soul for the Judgment Day, and
joined my gaze with his.  The eyes of all in the
house were upon us, I suppose&mdash;but I shall never
know.  We stood together, oblivious to all except
the destiny of weal or woe that waited us, looking,
both looking, as the eye of the Eternal itself might
look.  We could not&mdash;we dared not&mdash;be sure, lest
we might court the bitterness of death.  The light
was not bright enough, or true enough&mdash;for us to
stake our souls.  We feared exceedingly; and for
each other; wherefore neither spoke any word.
</p>

<p>
The scene was the great Broadway scene, where the
anguished father finds his son at last.  And the
tattered youth upon whom that father&mdash;that acting
father&mdash;gazed, on him our eyes were set in dreadful
silence, in questioning that involved our souls.  We
could not&mdash;we dared not&mdash;know; but suddenly the
old man on the stage&mdash;oh! the perjured wastery of
simulated love like that&mdash;broke forth with a wild
outcry of love and rapture as he leaped towards the
soiled and wasted prodigal before him.
</p>

<p>
And then&mdash;and then&mdash;mingling with the father's
chant, there came from the bowed and broken wanderer
one single note; a little cry, a muffled plaint of
penitence and hope.  It was such a little sound,
subdued and faltering as became a broken heart, and it
was almost lost in the father's louder strain&mdash;but I
heard it, and my soul laid hold of God.  Only a
stifled cry&mdash;but it was the same I had heard when I
first came out of the valley and my new-born baby boy
lay helpless at my breast; the same I had heard a
thousand times when he was hurt or wronged and
toddled in to me with the boyish story of his grief;
the same I had heard when he came home that night
and told me of his sin; the same I had heard when
he bent above his sleeping sister and kissed her a
long farewell.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Gordon," I said, fainting, "it's Harold&mdash;it's
our Harold!"
</p>

<p>
He knew it too.  And he left me where I was,
half conscious in uncle's arms.  I see it all again,
dismantled though I was, as in a dream.  The curtain
dropped just as uncle's arm received me, as Gordon
glided towards the narrow half-hidden passageway
leading to the stage.  Slowly it fell, right down close
to the floor, shutting out the last fragment of the
vision that had flooded our hearts with heaven.  Ah,
me! no one there&mdash;not even uncle&mdash;knew that for us
life's curtain had really risen, the play, the wonderful
play of life, only just begun.
</p>

<p>
The orchestra had softly started some subdued and
sympathetic air; I knew not, nor yet do know, what
strain it was&mdash;but it fell on my reviving heart with
the sweetness of such music as angels make&mdash;and my
eyes flew after Gordon as he was swallowed up of the
shadowy passageway that led back to that mysterious
region where actors are men and women, players
now no more.  I think somebody, some hireling who
knew not what he did, tried to turn Gordon from his
course&mdash;as well have tried to stop Niagara.  I fancy
I caught a glimpse of him as he swept the intruder
by&mdash;his eye was flashing, fearful in its purpose of
love and power, as though he were asserting his claim
to life itself.
</p>

<p>
He never stopped&mdash;this was described to me afterwards&mdash;till
he stood beside the pair of actors, the old
man and the young, already repairing to the
dressing-room behind.  And the old man's face, so they
told me, was a study to behold as he was swiftly
brushed aside, dispossessed, the unreality swallowed
up of Life as Gordon took the tattered form into the
arms that long emptiness had clothed with almost
savage strength.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my son!  Oh, Harold, my son, my son!"
was Gordon's low cry that all about could hear; for
the stillness of the grave was on every heart.  "Come,
come, we'll go to mother," came a moment later as
he turned and tried to lead Harold gently away.
</p>

<p>
I do not know all the son said to the father.  But
Gordon told me after how Harold clung to him as
though he were hiding for his life, speaking no word,
but burying his face as though none must see the
shame&mdash;or the holy gladness; and in a minute or
two, though I know not how long it was, some one in
authority said that the play must go on, that the
audience would be impatient and indignant.
</p>

<p>
"Then come, my son," said Gordon; "get your
clothes on, Harold, and we'll go&mdash;your mother, your
mother knows it's you," his face radiant, I ween, as it
turned upon his boy.
</p>

<p>
But Harold wouldn't&mdash;the play must be finished,
he said, and he must take his part.  Harold's face was
resolute, his father said, his words full of determination,
when he avowed his purpose to stay till his
work was done.  And really&mdash;it was one of the most
amusing sides of my husband's character I ever
saw&mdash;when Gordon told me this his face fairly shone
with pride.  "The lad wouldn't forsake his duty,"
he said, as proudly as if Harold had been a foreign
missionary instead of a play-actor; it was too funny
to hear Gordon, with the views I knew him to hold
about the theatre, belauding Harold because he
wouldn't leave his post even at such a time as that.
</p>

<p>
So his father came back and resumed his place
beside me.  No word escaped his lips, but his eyes
spoke the language of Everlasting Life as they were
fixed a moment on my own.  Uncle gazed at him&mdash;I
suppose everybody did&mdash;but he knew that question
or answer had no place in an hour such as this.
And the curtain rolled up again&mdash;ah, me! how
different now&mdash;and my hand was once more in Gordon's;
but now I could feel the strain of gratitude
and gladness that his happy heart was chanting.
Our eyes were fixed on Harold only; I heard his
voice amid that closing revelry&mdash;and my wild heart
leaped in my bosom as though my son were born to
me anew.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
We were home at last.  In the hotel, I mean, in
Gordon's room and mine&mdash;for uncle had gone to
rest.  Only a little tiny bit of a room it was&mdash;but it
was home; for we had Harold&mdash;and Dorothy was
asleep in an adjoining room.
</p>

<p>
Gordon went out for a little.  He said he wanted
to enquire about trains&mdash;but I knew why he left us
alone together.  Gordon was an eloquent minister&mdash;but
I was Harold's mother.  And there are queens
and priestesses, as well as kings and priests, unto
God.  Which Gordon knew.
</p>

<p>
It was while he and I were still alone with each
other that Harold broke out with bitter plaint of
penitence, so full of gusty sorrow, of self-reproach,
of broken vows and purposes.  I shall not, must not,
write it down.  It was all holy to me, and shall ever
be; for the breath of spring was in it, and I knew
then that God had brought him back, all back, the
broken heart sick of the sin and shame that he now
hated and deplored.  My son was alive again, I
knew in that moment; lost had he been indeed&mdash;but
God had kept aglow his memory of the Home-light
that never had gone out.
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't tell this to anybody else," the faltering
voice said as his face was hidden on my bosom&mdash;"not
even to father&mdash;what I'm going to tell you
now.  But I'm going to&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Tell it to God, my son," and I kissed the
quivering lips.
</p>

<p>
Gordon came back just after that.  I think he
must have known our souls had come close to each
other and to Him.  For a great peace was on his
face&mdash;and yet it shone with a kind of human
happiness that I thought was truly spiritual.  He
simply didn't seem to think there was anything
that needed reproach, or explanation, or forgiveness.
He talked with Harold about his old friends, his old
games, his old pursuits; and about what we would
do, and see, before we returned to Hertford.  Then
pretty soon he said it was time we were all in bed,
and, in the most natural way, that we would have
worship before we separated.  So he took the Bible.
But, before he opened it, he started one of the old
familiar psalms, just as we had always done at home.
</p>

<p>
"We'll sing the one hundred and twenty-sixth,"
he said, with something of grandeur in his manner
that reminded me of Harold's grandfather; for that
is one of the sublimities of the Scottish race.  I have
heard both Gordon and his father declare that
something could be found in the psalms to suit every
occasion, no matter what.  But I wondered what could
express the emotion of such a time as this.  "We'll
sing the one hundred and twenty-sixth," Gordon
repeated, already pitching the key to the "grave sweet
melody" of a tune that bore the happy name of
St. Andrew's.  And we sat in silence as he sang
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "When Zion's bondage God turned back<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As men that dreamed were we;<br />
  Then filled with laughter was our mouth<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our tongue with melody."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Harold's head was bowed; my eyes were fixed on
Gordon.  For my heart was busy with the thrilling
memory of that long distant night when I first had
heard the power of that earnest voice, first learned
the grandeur of these mighty songs.  Gordon
seemed unconscious of our presence.  His eyes
were lifted up, beyond the things of time: he
was like one lost among the hills, transported by
their grandeur.  Something more than human
ecstasy throbbed through his voice when he sang
the verse:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "As streams of water in the south<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bondage, Lord, recall;<br />
  Who sow in tears, a reaping time<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of joy enjoy they shall."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Then he read some selection from the Scriptures.
It was very short; and he read it slowly, his eyes
never lifted from the page.  When he prayed, he
talked with God&mdash;all I can remember was the way
he said "Our Father."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was long after midnight when he and I went to
our rest&mdash;we sat talking for hours and hours, and
Harold was asleep in the room next to ours.  Just
before we put out our light Gordon suddenly turned to
me, and his face was as youthful as when I saw it first.
</p>

<p>
"Helen, let us go and tuck Harold in&mdash;so he won't
be cold."
</p>

<p>
I smiled, for I couldn't but remember Harold's age,
but I threw a wrapper about me and Gordon and I
went in together.  We tucked him in, one on either
side; I don't know whether Harold knew or not,
but he played the part of childhood once again&mdash;when
we kissed him good-night he turned a little
in his sleep and smiled.

<h3>
XXX
<br /><br />
<i>EDEN IN THE ATTIC</i>
</h3>

<p>
I sometimes wonder what the other guests
thought of our behaviour at breakfast the next
morning.  Uncle was simply ridiculously happy,
even boisterously so.  And he wouldn't hear to any
dissent from the project that possessed his mind.
We must all go South with him, and that was the
end of it.  He and Aunt Agnes had never had a
difference in all their married life, he said, but the
trouble would begin right there if he went back
without us!  And he settled the whole thing an
hour later by suddenly appearing, after a very
mysterious absence, and flaunting in our faces the tickets
for the entire party.  They were taken via the
Old Dominion Line; and the little sea voyage would
be the very thing for all of us,&mdash;and Harold had assured
him that a release from his company could be easily
arranged.  So Gordon left it to me again&mdash;and I left
it to Harold, and Harold elected to see his mother's
old Virginia home.  Dorothy lent loud approval.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Thirty-six hours later we were in the dear old
Southern town, driving from the old familiar station
along the old familiar street.  My heart was full; its
burden was partly sadness, altogether song.
</p>

<p>
"Stop here," Gordon suddenly said to the driver
as we turned on to a street neither of us was likely
to forget.  "Come, Helen," as he held out his hand
to help me from my seat.
</p>

<p>
I knew.  It was under that very elm, just opposite
the church, I had first come face to face with
love&mdash;even if I did have a pitcher in my hand, <i>going for
the cream</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Drive on," said Gordon; "we'll join you later,"
and the carriage rolled away.
</p>

<p>
We followed, slowly; sometimes looking up into
the deep shade of the bending elms, sometimes into
each other's faces; with much of speech we walked&mdash;of
silence, sweeter silence, more.
</p>

<p>
Soon a turn in the road brought us in full view of
uncle's house.  There it stood, ivy-clad, the same
stately, frowning structure, looking forth at us as
calmly as though we had gone away but yesterday.
There was the magnolia tree beside the steps of
stone, not now in bloom but still spreading forth in
umbrageous beauty.  And there, just beyond, flowing
still, its copious stream unfailing, rolled the shining
river; rolling on, as time rolls on, unhasting,
unresting, bearing all its burdens in silence to the sea.
The years had passed and fled, yet the selfsame
wavelets could be seen&mdash;oh, parable of Time!  And
the bridge was there; repaired and strengthened
some, yet the same bridge it was on which I had
seen the love-lorn pair seek the shelter of the dark.
And I felt a shudder thrill my frame as I descried
the very pier that had been the scene of the tragedy
but for which Gordon had never made his noble protest;
but for which, our long years of exile had never
been.  I looked away.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Agnes was at the door as we climbed the
steps of stone.  She led me in and closed it tight
before she told me, with love's speech of silentness, all
the joy of welcome that was in her heart.  She was
thinking, and I was thinking, of the absent
one&mdash;oh! why these ever-absent ones?&mdash;whose face was
now withdrawn forever.  I roamed the hall; I
wandered about the broad porch; I drank my fill of the
library, dearest of them all&mdash;my mother's face met
me at every turn.  And I wondered, with passionate
hope that it might be so, if she knew that her child
had returned to the scene of girlhood days once
more; if she knew how laden with the spoils of time
I came, rich in the harvest that love and sorrow give,
anointed by the holy hand of suffering, by life's
fleeting vanities beguiled no more.
</p>

<p>
"Show Harold through the house, Helen," uncle
said to me when supper was over and the first tumult
had subsided; "let him see the old place from cellar
to attic.  It will be his some day, I reckon," and
his tone and glance left no doubt as to what he
meant.
</p>

<p>
I did as he directed, partly.  All but the attic.
Not yet must any enter there but me.  I soon
restored Harold to the merry circle&mdash;and then my
steps turned, almost reverently, towards that upper
room.  It did not take me long, what I had to do,
for love's task is soon accomplished.  And I knew it
would not be in vain&mdash;I knew that Gordon would
not fail me.  Yet my heart beat fast as I turned at
the attic door and looked back once more before I
went down-stairs.  Everything was perfect&mdash;and the
gentle breeze was ruffling the curtain of the tiny
window.
</p>

<p>
They were all in bed when Gordon and I betook
ourselves to the room set apart for us.  It was just
above the parlour, the largest and most imposing
apartment in all that roomy house.  A large
mahogany bed was planted, immovable, in the centre;
hand-carving, richly wrought, made the ceiling and
mantel things of beauty; oil-paintings hung upon the
lofty wall; soft draperies bedecked the windows.
</p>

<p>
We closed the door and Gordon looked about the
splendid room.  I began unpacking a valise that lay
upon the floor.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he came over and stood beside me.  One
hand touched my shoulder and I looked up.
</p>

<p>
"We're not going to sleep here," he said quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" I asked.  "Where?" although I knew,
and my bounding heart bespoke my joy.
</p>

<p>
"You know&mdash;come," with which he took up the
valise and led the way aloft.
</p>

<p>
The roof was low and I think Gordon really bowed
his head a little as we passed within that attic door.
The same discarded articles, finding their limbo here,
stood about the walls.  But the fire was crackling on
the hearth; the coverings on the bed were snowy
white; the silver toilet-set on the old bureau was the
same I had laid there so stealthily years before.  And
on the little table in the corner was a bowl of the
choicest roses, their fragrance floating through the
room.
</p>

<p>
I looked at Gordon.  Perhaps I was just a little
disappointed that he did not speak.  His eyes rested
on the fire, turned to the roses, lingering long.
</p>

<p>
"That's the same fire," he said slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Gordon," and I laughed; "how can you say that?"
</p>

<p>
"The very same," he persisted; "it never has gone
out.  And the roses too; they're the very
same&mdash;they've never faded."
</p>

<p>
"I thought you'd want to come here," I said,
stupidly enough; but I knew not what else to say.
"You know, you said&mdash;long ago, when you first
came here&mdash;you said you always loved an attic."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said simply, his eyes fixed on me; "yes,
I do."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" I asked, though I knew it was such a
foolish question.
</p>

<p>
He stood a long time silent in the firelight, his eyes
never moving from my face.  "Because it's nearest
heaven," he answered low; "come, Helen"&mdash;and
his arms were open wide.
</p>
